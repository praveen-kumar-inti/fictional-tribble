(R/O)
Rationale for identifying 
the risk / opportunity
In case of risk, approach to adapt or 
mitigate
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or negative 
implications)
1
Risk of Contract 
Attrition
Risk
Rising 
competition 
in 
wind energy may cause 
client loss and contract 
terminations. 
Weak 
contracts 
and 
poor 
financial 
safeguards 
increase risk of early exits 
and payment defaults.
Previously, 
the 
company 
faced 
contract attrition risks due to market 
shifts and competition. In response, 
it 
strengthened 
customer 
ties, 
offered incentives, and proactively 
renegotiated terms, resulting in a more 
stable contract base. To further mitigate 
risks, robust termination clauses have 
been introduced to ensure legal and 
financial 
protection. 
For 
payment 
issues, short-closing orders are being 
explored to limit financial strain. These 
measures enhance resilience and 
support long-term partnerships with 
customers and suppliers.
Risk: 
The 
rapidly 
evolving 
wind 
energy 
sector, 
driven 
by 
policy 
shifts 
and 
new 
entrants, increases the risk of 
client attrition and contract 
terminations. Without strong 
competitiveness 
and 
robust 
contractual 
safeguards, 
the 
company may face early exits, 
payment defaults, and financial 
strain, threatening operational 
stability 
and 
long-term 
partnerships.
2
Customer 
dissatisfaction 
/ damage 
relationship with 
customer.
Risk
Loss 
to 
reputation 
of 
organization 
and 
financial loss in form 
of 
compensation 
and 
penalty
To mitigate financial and contractual 
risks, The Company has enhanced 
execution capabilities to ensure timely 
project delivery and avoid Liquidated 
Damages. It has improved turbine 
availability 
to 
boost 
operational 
efficiency. By shifting to a limited-
scope model—focused on supply and 
supervision for IPPs—the Company 
reduces execution risks. For PSUs and 
key C&I clients, it continues offering 
turnkey solutions, backed by strong 
service quality and relationship-based 
negotiations 
to 
minimize 
financial 
exposure.
Risk: 
The 
Company 
faces 
financial risks from contractual 
disputes, payment delays, and 
penalties, especially in large PSU 
and C&I projects. The move to 
limited-scope IPP projects may 
heighten execution challenges, 
affecting profitability and client 
relationships.
3
Risk of Supply 
Chain Disruptions
Risk
The Company's reliance 
on a limited number 
of suppliers for critical 
components 
heightens 
risks of supply shortages, 
delays, 
and 
price 
fluctuations, 
potentially 
disrupting 
production 
timelines, cost efficiency, 
and project execution.
To 
mitigate 
Balsa 
Wood 
supply 
disruptions, 
the 
Company 
has 
strategically 
introduced 
Resin 
as 
an alternative in select applications, 
reducing 
dependency 
without 
compromising quality or performance. 
However, some critical blade sections 
still require Balsa Wood to maintain 
structural integrity and aerodynamic 
efficiency. This balanced approach 
helps minimize supply chain risks while 
ensuring adherence to performance 
standards.
Risk: The Company's reliance on 
a few key suppliers for critical 
components 
like 
gearboxes, 
castings, 
yaw 
systems, 
epoxy resin, and balsa wood 
poses risks of supply delays, 
shortages, and cost volatility. 
This concentrated sourcing has 
previously affected production 
timelines 
and 
cost 
control. 
Logistics delays or transport 
issues 
can 
further 
disrupt 
operations, impacting deadlines 
and cost-efficiency.
4
Technological 
Risks - Change in 
Key Technology
Risk
Reliance 
on 
external 
technology 
providers 
for critical components 
and upgrades may pose 
operational and strategic 
uncertainties.
The 
Company 
aims 
to 
mitigate 
technology-related risks through its 
secured license for 4MW Wind Turbine 
Generators, set for commercial launch 
in FY26. A new Gujarat facility will add 
800–1000 MW of capacity, enhancing 
adaptability to evolving tech and 
market demands. The company is 
also strengthening supplier ties for 
advanced materials, closely tracking 
regulatory changes, and adopting an 
agile development approach to stay 
aligned with emerging trends.
Risk: Changes in key technology 
pose 
risks 
to 
product 
performance, customer trust, 
and competitiveness. Deviations 
in 
efficiency 
may 
lead 
to 
financial loss and reputational 
damage. 
Misalignment 
with 
market needs or regulations can 
reduce adoption and revenue. 
Dependence 
on 
third-party 
tech adds uncertainty around 
upgrades, 
compatibility, 
and 
sustainability.

Chemicals

as

norms 
prescribed by the State 
Pollution Control Board 
for incineration & then

Statutory Manifest.
The Company is bearing the cost 
of such safe disposal of hazardous 
waste in terms of internal segregation, 
processing in machines, transportation 
to safe processing units, etc. as a 
part of its daily production activities. 
Required resources are accordingly 
budgeted, which is a major cost to 
the Company for the safe disposal of 
hazardous wastes.

achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
At Inox Wind, our commitment to sustainability is deeply embedded in our corporate ethos and long-term strategic vision. As a 
leading manufacturer of Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs), we recognize our pivotal role in accelerating the global transition to 
clean energy. Our operations are guided not only by commercial excellence but also by a strong sense of responsibility toward the 
environment, our people, and the communities in which we operate.
	
We have adopted a proactive approach to integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles across all facets of 
our business. From responsible sourcing to ethical operations and stakeholder engagement, sustainability is not a parallel goal—it is 
an integral part of our growth journey. We are proud to align our business ambitions with global sustainability goals and are working 
steadily toward achieving Net Zero Carbon operations by 2035.
	
Our short-term priorities include ensuring responsible sourcing of materials across our value chain and fostering a safe and healthy 
workplace for all employees. These actions are foundational to our commitment to human rights, labour practices, and environmental 
stewardship.
	
In the medium term, we are focused on minimizing the environmental impact of our manufacturing processes by reducing energy 
consumption, water usage, and waste generation. We are also implementing sustainable material sourcing practices and enhancing 
our waste management systems to promote circularity.
	
We are also committed to:
 
 
Increasing the share of renewable energy in our operations year-over-year.
 
 
Establishing a supplier code of conduct to ensure adherence to ESG criteria across our supply chain.
 
 
Investing in community development programs focused on education, healthcare, and skill-building, particularly in regions 
where we operate.
 
 
Strengthening our employee well-being programs with a focus on diversity, inclusion, and mental health.
 
 
Enhancing transparency by disclosing our ESG performance through globally recognized reporting frameworks.
	
Transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement are the cornerstones of our sustainability strategy. By meticulously 
mapping and disclosing our emissions footprint, we aim to lead by example in climate action and ESG performance.
	
We believe that by fostering innovation, upholding integrity, and prioritizing sustainability, we can create lasting value for all our 
stakeholders and contribute meaningfully to a low-carbon, equitable future.

The Company has established an inclusive and well-defined Grievance Redressal Procedure that is accessible to all employees 
and workers, offering a systematic approach for addressing workplace concerns. This policy promotes open dialogue and 
transparency, ensuring that any grievances raised are managed in a fair, respectful and policy-compliant manner.
Employees are encouraged to first bring up their concerns with their immediate supervisor, allowing for informal resolution through 
direct communication and mutual understanding. Should the grievance remain unresolved, or if the employee is uncomfortable 
approaching their supervisor, they may proceed to the formal grievance redressal process.
Under the formal mechanism, a detailed grievance report is submitted and reviewed by either the designated HR personnel or a 
dedicated grievance committee. This body is responsible for conducting an impartial and thorough investigation, ensuring that all 
aspects of the issue are considered. The process prioritizes fairness, confidentiality and the protection of all involved parties while 
striving to reach a just and balanced resolution.

for irrigation and used to water within the company premises. This sustainable practice ensures efficient water management and 
environmental responsibility.
