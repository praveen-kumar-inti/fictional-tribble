risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative 
implications)
1.
Climate 
Change and 
Resilience
Risk & 
Opportunity
The operations and business 
of an organization can be 
directly affected by critical 
sustainability risks such as 
climate change, water security, 
plastic waste, supply chain 
disruptions, and sourcing 
challenges. Additionally, 
regulatory and market transition 
risks associated with the shift 
to a low-carbon economy 
are present. These risks 
include changing consumer 
preferences, increased product 
costs, and future government 
policies and regulations.
1.	 JPL's primary consumption consists 
of large quantities of printing inks 
and paper. The goal is to improve 
bulk shipment and storage, aiming 
to reduce transportation impact and 
excessive packaging.
2.	 The Company has started using 'Vio 
Green Plate Technology' (waterless 
chemistry) to conserve water, 
installed various water harvesting 
structures, star-rated energy-efficient 
air conditioners, solar panels at 
various locations and LED lights to 
save and conserve energy.
3.	 The Company's objective is to reduce 
reliance on power supplied by the 
Electricity Board by transitioning 
to solar energy. Several units are 
already utilising solar power.
4.	 JPL has installed energy-efficient 
fixtures at the majority of its printing 
presses and offices.
5.	 The installation of a solar power plant 
at the Kanpur, Agra, Noida, Lucknow, 
Patna and Varanasi units ensures the 
use of renewable energy, thereby 
decreasing overall CO2 emissions. 
 Short Term: Negative 
Medium to Long Term: 
Positive Initiatives and 
endeavours aimed 
at mitigating climate 
change risks may 
result in additional 
costs in the short 
to medium term. 
However, these costs 
can be partially offset 
by long-term efficiency 
improvements. 
Moreover, these 
initiatives enhance 
business resilience 
and protect long-term 
value.
2.
Waste 
Management
Opportunity
By embracing waste 
management as an opportunity, 
we can reduce costs, enhance 
sustainability, comply with 
regulations, drive innovation, 
and contribute to a more 
circular economy. This not only 
benefits a company's bottom 
line but also strengthens its 
reputation and position in the 
market.
1.	 JPL is focused towards adapting 3R 
policy i.e., Reduce, Reuse & Recycle 
on the waste generated, leaving 
lesser waste for disposal to third 
party vendors.
2.	 The Company has a proper tracking 
mechanism for the waste generated 
and does not encourage in 
performing any hazardous activity in 
printing presses.
3.	 The Company endeavours to deliver 
waste materials (which cannot 
be reused or recycled internally) 
to vendors who sell the waste to 
recyclers. JPL strives to reuse the 
wastepaper generated during 
production activities by converting it 
into writing pads and using it in paper 
packaging to reduce the quantity 
of waste delivered to vendors. 
Regarding production wastage, we 
do not recycle paper/newsprint as it 
is directly purchased from vendors, 
and the finished product is delivered 
to the end user.
 Positive - Proper 
tracking and 
monitoring of 
waste generated 
along with source 
mapping reduces the 
total overall waste 
generated along with 
reducing the waste 
disposal cost.

 Water 
Management
Opportunity
 Water is foreseen as an 
opportunity at Jagran as 
majority of the water is 
consumed for domestic usage 
and minimal amount in process 
of printing.
1.	 JPL has installed Effluent Treatment 
Plants at all printing presses where 
industrial effluents are treated and 
then discharged.
2.	 The Company started using ‘Vio 
Green Plate Technology’ (waterless 
chemistry) to save water.
3.	 We have installed various water 
harvesting structures to conserve 
water.
 Positive - Use of ETP 
helps in use of the 
treated water into 
domestic processes 
like gardening and 
toilet flushing
4.
 Human Capital 
Development
Opportunity
The success of the Company's 
operations relies on the 
ongoing dedication, skills, 
and expertise of its corporate 
and divisional executive 
teams, as well as other highly 
qualified employees who 
possess extensive knowledge 
in business, technology, 
and operations. The market 
for skilled professionals is 
highly competitive, and while 
there may be challenges, the 
Company remains committed 
to attracting, retaining, and 
developing top talent and 
is confident in its ability to 
manage workforce transitions 
efficiently and cost-effectively.
1.	 Investing in training and development 
programs.
2.	 Offering opportunities for growth 
and development demonstrates 
our commitment to our employee’s 
professional growth.
3.	 Building a robust talent pipeline 
across responsibility levels through 
requisite quality in key roles.
4.	 Maintaining fair wages basis 
performance/appraisal or industry 
standard & applicable code.
5.	 The Company maintains an employee 
friendly work environment
 Positive - Human 
Capital Development 
can improve the skills 
and knowledge of 
employees. This can 
lead to increased 
productivity, improved 
product quality, and 
operational efficiency 
within the Company.
5.
Occupational 
Health & Safety
Risk
 Providing comprehensive 
training on safety procedures, 
compliance regulations, and 
ethical practices fosters a 
secure work environment, 
reduces accidents, ensures 
adherence to regulatory 
requirements, and safeguards 
the Company against legal and 
reputational risks
1.	 The Company has established an 
On-site Emergency Control Plan, 
encompassing bi-annual mock drills 
involving government authorities 
and neighbouring large industries. 
Additionally, regular safety training 
sessions are conducted, and all 
employees at the manufacturing 
plants are equipped with necessary 
safety gear.
2.	 For further details, refer Question No. 
10 of Principle 3.
 Negative - non-
adherence to the 
health and safety 
protocols can 
impact on the health 
and wellbeing of 
employees of the 
Company.
6.
Corporate 
Governance & 
Ethics
Risk
 Adverse financial and 
reputational risks may arise due 
to unethical business conduct 
and non-compliance to 
regulatory requirements
1.	 JPL has a strong governance 
mechanism so as to comply with 
all the regulatory requirements 
from local and national regulatory 
authorities.
2.	 Mechanism in place to avoid 
workforce discrimination, sexual 
harassment and provide free & fair 
working environment for employees.
3.	 Development of Code of Conduct 
and whistle blower policy for its 
employees and vendors.
 Negative - Ethical 
business practices and 
compliance 
to regulatory 
requirements 
will prevent non-
compliance and 
potential regulatory 
fines from the 
government.
7.
 Innovation 
Technology
Opportunity
Innovation and technology are 
an integral part of business as 
it creates an opportunity for 
JPL to expand its business in 
different directions. Innovation 
and R&D can contribute to 
bringing up new processes 
and technologies in printing 
process.
1.	 JPL has identified various 
opportunities to expands its business 
within printing industry using 
innovation and R&D.
2.	 There are various projects JPL has 
undertaken in collaboration with 
external stakeholders to improve the 
efficiency of existing process and to 
establish a new product market in 
printing industry.
 Positive - Innovation 
and R&D will lead 
to financial benefits 
to the Company by 
optimizing the existing 
printing process.

 Transparency 
& Reporting
Risks
 Failure in regulatory reporting 
and disclosures will lead to lack 
of transparency to the internal 
as well as external stakeholders 
and will spoil the reputation of 
the Company and also leads 
to loss of trust reposed by its 
Investors and consumers.
JPL ensures timely regulatory 
reporting and disclosure of all the 
necessary details to its internal and 
external stakeholders through the 
stock exchanges, MCA Portal and the 
Company's corporate website.
 Positive -Timely 
reporting and 
transparency will keep 
the trust reposed by 
investors and 
consumers along 
with the government 
authorities in the 
Company, which will 
lead to a positive 
financial impact as it 
avoids any potential 
regulatory fine.
9.
Consumer 
Relationship 
Management
Risks
Consumer relationship 
management is vital for JPL 
business where the Company 
takes feedback from consumers 
to improve the product 
quality sold by the Company. 
Improper consumer feedback 
management may lead to a 
decline in JPL's business and 
can affect the reputation of the 
Company.
JPL has a dedicated mechanism to 
collect consumer feedback and work on 
it to improve the Company's products 
and services
Positive - The 
dedicated help 
line mechanism/
channel for collecting 
feedback from the 
consumers will 
increase consumer's 
trust in the Company's 
product and services 
which in turn provides 
financial benefits to 
the Company.
10.
Community 
Engagement	
Opportunity
Opportunity
Corporate Social Responsibility 
is an opportunity to the 
Company as it provides a

•	
Educated Society: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and 
promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.
•	
Women Empowerment: Achieve gender equality and empower all women 
and girls.
•	
Environment Conservation: Take urgent action to combat climate change 
and its impacts. Sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and 
reverse land degradation, halt biodiversity loss. Ensure access to affordable, 
reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.
•	
Water Conservation: Ensure access to clean drinking water and sanitation for 
all.
•	
Population Management: Promote inclusive and sustainable economic 
growth, employment and decent work for all.
In alignment with these principles, the Company has established a comprehensive 
ESG roadmap underpinned by a strong governance framework. This approach 
enables the integration of environmental, social, and governance priorities into 
its core business strategy, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable growth and 
responsible decision-making.

R&D
The raw materials used in newspaper production are 
sourced externally through third-party vendors, and as 
such, there is no direct investment in in-house research 
and development (R&D) for this aspect. However, 
we maintain ongoing engagement with our vendors 
to remain updated on emerging technologies and 
environmental considerations in the newsprint sector. 
These collaborative exchanges involve minimal costs.
The raw materials required for newspaper 
production are procured externally from vendors, 
which means there is no direct investment in 
research and development (R&D) in this area. 
Nonetheless, we engage in regular discussions 
with our vendors to stay informed about the latest 
technological advancements and environmental 
issues related to newsprint. The costs associated 
with these discussions are negligible.
Capex
JPL has undertaken a range of sustainability initiatives 
across its operations, focusing on energy efficiency, 
emissions reduction, and water conservation. In the 
reporting year, 5.90% of the Company’s total capital 
expenditure (CAPEX) was directed towards the 
installation of solar panels and procurement of electric 
vehicles, aimed at reducing its carbon footprint. These 
investments align with our broader commitment to 
combating climate change through enhanced process 
efficiency and energy-saving measures.
To conserve water, the Company has implemented 
innovative solutions such as ‘Vio-Green Plate 
Technology,’ a waterless chemistry process. Additional 
measures include the installation of water harvesting 
structures, energy-efficient star-rated air conditioners, 
solar panels across various facilities, and LED lighting 
systems to reduce energy consumption. Resource 
optimization is further supported through stringent 
operational controls and the establishment of waste 
norms for each plant. Waste generation is monitored 
closely to ensure plant-specific thresholds are 
maintained. Furthermore, Effluent Treatment Plants 
(ETPs) have been set up to treat and reuse wastewater 
for non-potable applications like gardening, cleaning, 
and toilet flushing. While JPL does not engage in 
recycling activities directly, all recyclable waste is 
routed through authorized vendors who sell it to 
recycling partners.
JPL has implemented several initiatives across 
its operations in areas such as energy efficiency, 
emissions management, and water conservation. 
The Company has allocated 2.40% of its total 
capital expenditures (CAPEX) to the installation of 
solar panels and effluent treatment plants (ETPs) 
in the reporting year. These investments are 
part of our efforts to address climate change by 
enhancing process efficiency and pursuing energy-
saving measures. For example, the Company 
has adopted 'Vio-Green Plate Technology,' a 
waterless chemistry approach, to conserve 
water. We have also installed water harvesting 
structures, energy-efficient air conditioners with 
star ratings, solar panels at various plants and 
LED lighting to reduce energy consumption. To 
make the most of our limited resources, we have 
implemented operational controls to minimize 
waste and established waste norms for each plant. 
We closely monitor plant-specific waste levels 
to ensure they remain within acceptable limits. 
Additionally, we have established ETPs to treat 
and reuse wastewater for non-potable purposes, 
such as gardening, cleaning, and toilet flushing. 
While the Company ensures that other waste 
materials are delivered to vendors who sell the 
waste to recyclers, we do not engage in recycling 
ourselves.

(a)	 Plastics (including packaging)
Due to the nature of its operations, the Company has limited 
avenues to integrate recycled materials into its production 
processes, with paper being the primary exception. Since 
paper and newsprint are directly sourced from vendors and 
supplied as finished products to end users, internal recycling 
of these materials is not applicable.
Newsprint is procured both domestically and through imports, 
with Indian manufacturers contributing 70.67% of the total 
supply most of which consists of recycled content.
In the reporting year, the Company generated a minimal 
volume of e-waste, which was responsibly disposed of through

As outlined in other sections of this report, the Company is committed to responsible waste management. Waste materials 
that cannot be reused or recycled internally are handed over to authorized vendors, who, in turn, supply them to recyclers. 
JPL actively seeks to minimize waste generation by repurposing wastepaper generated during production processes into 
writing pads and paper-based packaging materials, thereby reducing the volume of waste sent to external vendors.
In terms of production waste, the Company does not recycle paper or newsprint, as these materials are directly procured 
from suppliers and converted into finished products for end users. Newsprint is sourced both domestically and through 
imports, with a larger share procured from Indian manufacturers. This domestically sourced newsprint largely comprises 
recycled content.

As part of its broader waste management practices, JPL has also recycled 1.77 MT of e-waste during the year, reinforcing 
its commitment to sustainable and responsible disposal of electronic waste.

Category
(If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent Workers
At JPL, we are committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and supportive work 
environment for all employees and workers. To uphold this commitment, the 
Company has implemented a Vigil Mechanism/Whistleblower Policy that 
enables Directors and employees to report genuine concerns or grievances. 
The policy outlines a clear procedure for raising such concerns and ensures 
adequate safeguards against victimization for those who come forward.
The mechanism also allows for direct access to the Chairperson of the Audit 
Committee. In instances where complaints are found to be frivolous or made 
with malicious intent, the Chairperson is empowered to take appropriate 
disciplinary action, including issuing a reprimand.
In addition, the Company has adopted comprehensive Human Resource 
policies, including a Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) Policy, which 
promotes a respectful, harassment-free workplace and provides structured 
mechanisms for grievance redressal and conflict resolution.
All grievance redressal mechanisms under these policies are accessible to 
both permanent and non-permanent employees and workers.

utilization of resources. While the Policy currently does not extend to external stakeholders—such as suppliers, contractors, 
and NGOs—the Company maintains a zero-tolerance approach toward hazardous activities and encourages all stakeholders 
to contribute to environmental sustainability.
To this end, the Company has implemented various initiatives across its operations, focusing on energy efficiency, emissions 
control, and water management. JPL is actively addressing climate change through process improvements and energy-
saving measures. Notable examples include the adoption of ‘Vio-Green Plate Technology’ (a waterless chemistry solution), 
installation of water harvesting structures, energy-efficient air conditioners with star ratings, solar panels at various locations, 
and widespread use of LED lighting to reduce energy consumption.
Further, the Company’s editorial content policy includes dedicated principles on environmental protection and water 
conservation. Through its daily publications and focused content, the Company seeks to raise awareness, educate readers, 
and promote active participation in tackling environmental challenges.

summary)
Outcome of the initiative
1.
Set up of 
Effluent 
Treatment Plant 
(ETP)
The Company has implemented Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) at all 
its facilities. Treated water from these plants is reused for purposes such 
as gardening, flushing, and cleaning, or directed toward groundwater 
recharge, depending on site-specific suitability. The Company remains 
committed to expanding this initiative and aims to equip all its printing units 
with ETPs to ensure sustainable water management across operations.
The reuse of treated 
wastewater 
for 
non-
potable 
applications—
such 
as 
gardening, 
cleaning, and flushing—
helps 
significantly 
reduce the dependency 
on 
freshwater 
withdrawal.
2.
Vio-Green Plate 
Technology
The Company continues to address climate change by enhancing 
process efficiency and implementing energy-saving initiatives. A key step 
in this direction has been the adoption of ‘Vio-Green Plate Technology,’ 
which utilizes waterless chemistry in the printing process. This innovation 
significantly reduces water usage by eliminating the need for conventional 
plate processing methods. Through the use of this technology, the Company 
has been able to achieve meaningful reductions in water consumption, 
supporting its broader sustainability and resource conservation goals.
This practice conserves 
water 
at 
operational 
facilities and contributes 
to 
a 
meaningful 
reduction in fresh water 
withdrawal.
3.
Installed Star 
Rated systems 
& Renewable 
energy
The Company continues to invest in renewable energy and energy 
efficiency initiatives as part of its commitment to sustainable operations. 
Efforts include the installation of star-rated systems, energy-efficient air 
conditioning units, and LED lighting across office spaces. LED lighting has 
been deployed in key areas such as workspaces, canteens, and parking 
zones, contributing to a notable reduction in overall energy consumption. 
Additionally, JPL has implemented rooftop solar installations at several 
facilities, including Patna, Noida, Agra, Varanasi, Lucknow and Kanpur 
locations.
The adoption of energy-
efficient air conditioning 
systems 
and 
LED 
lighting 
supports 
ongoing 
energy 
conservation 
efforts, 
while 
the 
integration 
of renewable energy 
sources 
further 
strengthens 
the 
Company’s commitment 
to 
sustainable 
operations.

Apart from the mandated CSR activities, we have also launched the following new initiatives:
Every day, Jagran delivers enriching and empowering content to its readers in line with these seven principles. This ranges 
from a daily column on health and wellbeing, to youth-centric supplement focusing on providing them with access to job 
opportunities and to content catering specifically to the needs of women readers. Beyond the content, the Company also 
leverages its massive reach to organize initiatives that are in spirit of these seven principles and have the potential to mobilize 
citizens and generate ground-level impact. The Company launched the following new initiatives:
	−
Punjab Potholes campaign: Dainik Jagran tackled Punjab’s pothole crisis through a unique public awareness campaign. 
With government inaction, they highlighted potholes using white lime powder, skull marks, and blood stains to draw 
attention. The newspaper published 425 pothole images and 100 full-page reports in 60 days, mobilizing 30,000+ 
people to mark potholes. The campaign empowered communities proved the power of media, and drove real change 
in civic infrastructure.
	−
Cyber Fraud Awareness Campaign: Cyber-fraud in India has shifted from random phishing to industrial-scale syndicates. 
Daily complaints are spiraling out of control. Digital-arrest cons epitomize this evolution. Low cyber-hygiene, mass UPI 
uptake and easy access to spoofed SIMs heighten exposure. To create public awareness, we mounted our campaign 
“Lootera Online”. Besides content in the newspapers, we got on ground and conducted workshops at offices and 
RWAs, seminars, and appointed Cyber commandoes (champions) who helped spread awareness on how to prevent 
cyber fraud. 
	−
Mental and Physical Health Awareness Campaign: We continued our awareness campaign on physical and mental 
health. The campaign specifically covered Mental health issues and alleviating stress. Our campaign message focused 
on preventive healthcare. 
	−
Jagran Arpan: This was a campaign launched during winters that appealed to people to donate generously with warm 
clothes for the homeless and poor sections of the society.

	−Jagran Sanskarshala: Adolescence is a transformative phase, yet its complexities remain difficult to grasp. Young people 
today are active change-makers, using media to advocate for social justice, education, and climate action. However, 
traditional media must evolve to stay relevant in their digital, fast-paced world. Dainik Jagran recognized this and launched 
Sanskarshala—a campaign addressing adolescent moral development, ethical dilemmas, and societal challenges. Through 
editorial stories, school collaborations, expert workshops, and a large-scale survey, the newspaper became both a guide 
and catalyst for youth empowerment. By fostering critical thinking, Dainik Jagran ensured its role in shaping a principled, 
confident generation.
	−Hindi Hai Hum: We continued our efforts on building our “Hindi Hai Hum” platform to evangelize Hindi and help extend 
the market for Hindi because we believe that a language lives when people take pride in their language and celebrate it. 
Under this campaign we conducted “Samwadi” – the festival of expressions across 5 cities and we released our quarterly 
Hindi Best Seller lists.
Jagran is also cognizant of the environmental impact of its operations and undertakes several initiatives to minimize the 
same. The details of these initiatives are included under Principle 6.
