Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and

We Refex Industries Limited (RIL) are pleased to present our First Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), which 
outlines our commitment to the nine principles of the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) in India. As 
a responsible and sustainable business, we believe it is essential to adhere to these guidelines to ensure the well-being of all our

At RIL, we are committed to creating sustainable value for all our stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers,

are continuously striving to improve our practices. We have developed a comprehensive Sustainability Framework that guides our 
business decisions, and we regularly measure our performance against industry benchmarks and international standards.
We are committed to engaging with our stakeholders to understand their needs and concerns, and we work closely with them 
to address any issues that may arise. We believe that open communication and collaboration are essential to building trust and 
creating sustainable value for all.
Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues are critical to the long-term success of our business and society. We recognize 
the importance of ESG megatrends and challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, inequality, diversity and inclusion, 
and ethical behavior. As a responsible business, we are committed to reducing our environmental impact, promoting sustainable 
practices, and conserving natural resources. We also prioritize the well-being of our employees, suppliers, customers, and the 
communities in which we operate, by promoting a safe, healthy, and inclusive workplace, ensuring ethical and sustainable practices 
in our supply chain, and contributing to community development. Additionally, we maintain strong governance practices, promoting 
transparency, accountability, and ethical behavior throughout our operations.
Although BRSR is not mandatory for us, we are pleased to disclose our ESG performance voluntarily through this BRSR framework
