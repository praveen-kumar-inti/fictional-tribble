ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25
BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
The Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between a business's 
financial performance and its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices. By encouraging the disclosure of 
non-financial information, the BRSR enables regulators, investors, and stakeholders to gain a comprehensive understanding 
of a company's overall business stability, growth, and sustainability. This comprehensive reporting framework goes beyond 
financial metrics, providing valuable insights into a company's ESG commitments, risk management practices, social impact, 
and environmental stewardship. By emphasizing the importance of non-financial disclosure, the BRSR promotes transparency, 
accountability, and the integration of sustainable practices into a company's core operations.

1. 
Cyber Security
R
Cyberattack is a global threat  for 
major 
industrial 
organizations 
including the generating plants
The company adheres 
to the requirements laid 
down by GoI. Group 
CISO keeps continuous 
check on internal as well 
as external factors. 
Negative Impacts
2.
Flexible 
Operation
R
Due to increasing solar generation, 
the demand of power from thermal 
plants reduces in day hours and 
thermal machines are operated at 
lower generation, which leads to 
stresses in the generating systems 
(BTG) (To meet generator schedule 
given by SLDC/WRLDC)
JPVL abide with the 
requirements of SLDC/
WRLDC. Power is sold 
through 
exchange 
to 
maintain generation as 
much as possible
Negative Impacts
3. 
Obsolesces in 
Technology 
R & O
Sometimes it becomes difficult to 
get the spares or support for the 
equipment or systems, installed at the 
time of commissioning of power plant
Sufficient 
spares 
are 
maintained, 
in-house 
strength is developed 
for 
Repair 
and 
maintenance. Systems 
are upgraded with latest 
technology
Positive Impact
4.
Economy
O 
The demand of power is increasing 
in the nation and to strengthen the 
power sector, more investments are 
likely in this sector and support is 
expected from Govt and other stake 
holders.
N.A.
Positive Implications
5.
Labour 
Management
R
Power industry requires a skilled 
workforce to operate and maintain 
complex 
power 
generation 
and 
distribution 
systems. 
Economic 
conditions, 
demographic 
shifts, 
and industry competition can lead 
to shortages of qualified workers in 
critical roles. The lack of skilled labour 
can hamper day-to-day operations, 
hinder maintenance activities, and 
impact the overall efficiency of power 
generation facilities. 
The 
Company 
is 
concentrating 
on 
imparting best trainings 
to its work force to 
enhance the skills and 
thus to avoid accidents 
and human losses. The 
Company is ensuring 
inclusive 
management 
as per best international 
practices. All our sites 
are ISO 45001 certified. 
Negative

is 
being 
conducted 
on 
how 
to utilise the Ash in

7. 
Renewable 
Energy
O
By seizing the opportunity to diversify 
their energy sources by investing 
in renewable energy projects. By 
incorporating 
renewable 
energy 
technologies, such as solar, wind, 
hydroelectric, or geothermal power, 
into their generation portfolio, the 
company can reduce their reliance on 
fossil fuels and contribute to the de-
carbonization of the energy sector. 
The Company's run-of-
river hydroelectric plant 
is producing renewable 
energy, contributing to 
a greener power supply. 
Positive Implications
8.
Raw Material 
Sourcing
R
The Company rely on various raw 
materials such as coal, water or 
biomass 
for 
power 
generation. 
Fluctuations in the prices of these 
raw materials can impact operational 
costs and profitability. 
The 
Hydro 
Electric 
Plant 
uses 
perpetual 
and sustainable source 
of raw material (water). 
However 
JNSTPP 
Thermal 
Plant 
is 
secured by captive coal 
mines. 
Positive Implications
9. 
Air Emissions
R
Emissions generated can contribute 
to 
environmental 
concerns 
and 
climate change. Power companies 
face reputational risks if they are 
perceived 
as 
significant 
emitters 
or not doing enough to reduce 
their environmental impact. Public 
perception can influence consumer 
behaviour, investor confidence, and 
stakeholder relationships. 
The 
VPHEP 
is 
generating 
green 
energy. 
However 
for 
JNSTPP and JBTPP, the 
Company is adhering  to 
the emission means of 
MoEF & CC.
Negative 
Implications

Local 
Community
O
Contribute 
to 
local 
economic 
development

The 
Company 
is 
extending 
various 
educational 
and 
medical facilities in the 
neighbourhood of plants 
through CSR activities. 
Positive Implications
11.
Supply Chain
O
By actively engaging with suppliers, the 
company can tap into their expertise 
and leverage their capabilities to 
foster a culture of innovation. Through 
collaborative efforts, the company 
can work alongside suppliers to 
explore new ideas, develop advanced 
solutions, and push the boundaries 
of technological advancements in the 
energy sector.

Governance, leadership and oversight

Statement by Director, responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility 
regarding the placement of this disclosure)
JP Power Ventures Ltd. firmly acknowledges the risks is not only a moral imperative but also a critical business strategy for our long-term success and sustainability. The power sector 
plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of our planet. While it is essential for meeting the energy demands of a growing population, it also carries significant responsibilities towards 
minimizing environmental impact, promoting social well-being, and upholding high standards of governance. Failing to address these issues adequately can lead to reputational 
damage, legal repercussions, and financial instability, all of which can hinder our progress as a responsible and forward-thinking industry leader.
ESG considerations encompass a broad range of factors, including but not limited to climate change mitigation, energy efficiency, renewable energy integration, pollution control, 
community engagement, human rights, diversity and inclusion, and ethical business practices. Each of these aspects poses unique challenges and risks that we must proactively 
address.
The company is committed to ensuring that operations align with the principles of sustainability and responsible stewardship. To this end, the Company is implementing robust ESG risk 
management frameworks, conduct regular assessments of our environmental and social impact, and promote transparency and accountability throughout our organization. Moreover, 
the Company will also seek to collaborate with industry partners, policymakers, and communities to drive positive change and find innovative solutions to complex challenges.
Recognizing the significance of ESG considerations in the power sector, the company will allocate the necessary resources and expertise to enhance our capabilities in this domain. 
The company will invest more in research and development, foster a culture of continuous learning, and empower our employees to actively contribute to our ESG goals.
By addressing the ESG related risks and challenges in the power sector, the company is not only safeguarding their own future but also fulfilling our duty to the planet and the 
communities we serve. Together, let us embark on this transformative journey, demonstrating our unwavering commitment to sustainable practices, responsible growth, and a brighter 
future for generations to come.

which are then kept in a covered shed within an isolated and fenced area. This storage method 
follows the guidelines outlined in the Hazardous Waste (Management, Handling, and Trans 
boundary Movement) Rules. The stored hazardous waste is subsequently sent to authorized 
recyclers for proper disposal. Additionally, both hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated 
at these plants are disposed of in accordance with the consent conditions set by the MPPCB 
(Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board).
At the Vishnuprayag plant, hazardous and toxic waste is handed over to authorized agencies 
specialized in disposal. Bio-medical waste is appropriately disposed off in a pit, which is 
approved by the Nagar Palika (Municipal Council) of Joshimath.
For the Amelia Coal Mines, the reception, collection, and storage of hazardous waste strictly 
adhere to the Hazardous Waste (Management and Trans boundary Movement) Rules of 
2016. The hazardous waste generated is collected in 210 litre drums/barrels and stored in a 
designated covered storage shed that has an impervious lining, ensuring containment. The 
personnel working on-site are provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) for their 
safety, and fire-fighting arrangements are in place to mitigate any potential risks.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? (YES/NO). Details of entity at which 
business continuity and disaster management plan is placed or web link.
	
Yes. The Company ensures that all sites of JPVL are ISO 45001 certified and possess well-established Disaster Management 
Plans. 
	
Specifically, JNSTPP has an approved On-Site Emergency Plan in place. The company has formulated the emergency 
planning of the plant to ensure that, despite all precautionary measures, personnel are capable of effectively handling any 
potential disaster and obtaining necessary help and assistance to minimize losses. Ongoing training on On-Site Emergency 
Plans is provided to all employees through TNI. To enhance preparedness, emergency contact numbers for Fire, Hospital, 
and CCR are prominently displayed at various locations within the facilities.
	
At JBTPP, the initiation of the On-Site Disaster Management Plan is signalled by raising the alarm or alert. Any employee who 
notices an unusual event, such as a fire, or release of flammable liquids, or chlorine, is responsible for raising the alarm or 
informing someone who can do so promptly. Given that the plant operates round the clock with constant occupation, visual 
detection and alarm-raising measures are easily accessible. 
	
At Vishnuprayag Hydro plant also, the company has implemented a Crisis/Disaster Management Plan that complies with ISO 
14001 standards. This plan is overseen by a 12-member Crisis/Disaster Management Committee, with the Director serving 
as the Chairman. Regular mock drills are conducted to simulate various contingencies, including floods, earthquakes, fires, 
and terrorist attacks, ensuring preparedness and effective response capabilities. Automatic Flood Warning System (AFWS) 
has been installed in the upstream on river Alaknanda which is designed to give automatic warning alarm in case of floods 
in the river. The data of this system is shared with NHPC also. Mock drills are also carried out on regular basis.
