24.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues. 
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social 
matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or 
mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format

1
Climate Change 
and Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Climate change has resulted in virtual and 
hybrid working models, propelling the need for 
NIIT’s online training modules. Considering we 
are already in the space of transition to virtual 
and hybrid work models; climate change poses 
a valuable advantage to our business
-
Positive
2
Talent Attraction 
and Development
Opportunity
Being a talent development corporation, 
developing our own human capital is a key 
strategic imperative for us at NIIT. We provide a 
strong learning culture within the organization. 
We also place a disproportionate focus and 
continuous investment in growing a pool of 
leaders. We have executive development 
programs running for all levels of the company: 
for individual contributors, managers and 
leaders. 
We employ technology solutions to improve 
employee experience, eg. we are implementing 
Success Factors; we have an AI BOT for 
engagement surveys; and we use an online 
portal for wellness initiatives. 
-
Positive
3
Employee health 
and safety
Opportunity
Poor work environments and unsafe practices 
can deter employee retention and discourage 
workplace efficiency or productivity. Lost 
time injuries create loss of productivity and 
mental dissatisfaction of employees. Given the 
COVID-19 pandemic, employee demands have 
shifted to mental and emotional wellness rather 
than only that of physical. 
Employee well-being has been an important 
focus area for NIIT. When COVID first impacted 
us, we already had in place a wellness portal 
called Round Glass which was used for various 
health and wellness programs. We also had a 
panel of experts to take care of mental wellness. 
During the COVID period, we took care of 
the complete expenses related to treatment 
for employees and for their dependents. We 
also extended monthly monetary support, and 
educational support to the children of bereaved 
families. 
Our online wellness portal has more than 50% 
of employees participating in webinars on areas 
related to health and wellbeing. We also drive 
health and wellness initiatives through a tie 
up with Cultfit, and provide free sponsorship 
of membership to our employees. We take 
continuous feedback from NIITians through 
engagement surveys and feedback to design 
and incorporate newer initiatives in the area of 
wellbeing.

Data Privacy and 
Cyber Security
Risk
Risks from cyber threats which may arise are 
malware attack, social engineering attack and 
software supply chain attacks. There is a high 
risk of theft of sensitive customer data, which is 
not only a data privacy risk but also reputational 
risk to the organization.
NIIT 
has 
multiple 
controls in place for 
example 
SOD, 
MFA, 
disk 
encryption 
and 
disablement of USB to 
ensure protection from 
IT risks and data privacy. 
We have a stringent 
cyber security and data 
privacy policy to ensure 
timely evasion of threats 
and 
management 
of 
data, 
to 
deter 
any 
risks that emerge from 
data privacy and cyber 
security. 
Negative
5
Business Ethics 
and Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Business ethics are cornerstones of ensuring 
transparent 
and 
sustainable 
corporate 
governance frameworks. Upholding policies 
such as code of conduct and anti-bribery & 
corruption and good-governance measures to 
effectively implement stringent actions, among 
others tantamount to strong business ethics. 
When such business ethics are not complied 
with it often leads to significant reputational 
damage.
NIIT has a Code of Conduct in place to ensure 
compliance with standards of business practices 
and legal requirements for all its employees and 
workers. We also have comprehensive anti-
bribery and anti-corruption policy and measures 
to ensure compliance and management of risks. 
Policies such as whistleblower, related party 
transactions, etc. are also existent and material 
to business.
-
Positive
6
Supply chain 
Management
Risk
Supply chain management affects product 
and service quality, delivery, costs, customer 
experience 
and 
ultimately, 
profitability. 
Increased supply chain disruptions at the wake 
of geopolitical transitions, and crises such as the 
pandemic result in loss of business continuity. 
Lack of inclusive supply chains creates vacuum 
at the time of a crises and a robust supply chain 
includes local sourcing, also boosting local 
economies and disadvantaged communities.
The organization operation depends significantly 
on value chain partner and it maintains a 
very wide base of such partners globally with 
ability to sources at very short interval to meet 
customer demands . The value proposition to 
its enterprise customers that the organization 
provides is the ability to meet certain surges of 
demand while, on the other hand, not requiring 
customers to have any fixed commitment.

Customer 
Concentration
Opportunity
NIIT has grown to earn the trust of many Fortune 
1000 and Global 500 companies in over 30 
countries over the past 41 years. Trusted by the 
world’s leading companies, NIIT provides high-
impact managed learning solutions that weave 
together the best of learning theory, technology, 
operations, and services to enable a thriving 
workforce.
The 
customer 
base 
of the organization is 
mostly among Fortune 
1000 and Global 500 
companies, where the 
risk of failure of those 
customers is low and 
there is a steep entry 
barrier.
More 
and 
more 
organizations 
are 
approaching 
training 
organizations 
for 
outsourcing; 
hence 
there 
are 
significant 
opportunities 
in 
the 
market. NIIT, to improve 
its market share and 
customer base, takes 
the inorganic route by 
way of acquisitions to 
improve 
its 
customer 
base.
Further industry specific 
programs like Pharma, 
ONG and BFSI are 
designed to penetrate 
with multiple customers 
in 
their 
respective 
segments.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases. 
	
The policy and processes comply with the prevailing laws, specifically the “The Sexual Harassment of Women at 
Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.” In case any employee experiences any form of sexual 
harassment, they can report the incident by directly writing to the care4women@niit.com / grievancecell@niit.com. The 
complaints raised via this channel are investigated, and handled with utmost fairness, equality and confidentiality by the 
Internal Complaints Committee (ICC). The ICC includes independent professionals from all walks of life. NIIT further 
ensures that standard SLAs as per law are met timely and in a just manner.

NIIT has conducted self-assessment for 100% of its offices. The organization’s 
Code of Conduct requires engagement of people considering child labor, modern 
slavery, and ethical practices. NIIT also has an Internal Complaints Committee and 
has clear channels of reporting any workplace sexual harassment. NIIT creates

8.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues. 
	
NIIT is committed to providing a fair, safe and productive work environment where grievances, if any, are dealt sensitively 
and expeditiously. A grievance policy and process is in place for NIITians to voice their concerns so they could be 
effectively addressed. A grievance may be about an act, omission, situation, or decision that the NIITian feels is unfair, 
discriminatory, or unjustified. 
	
NIITians are encouraged to come forward with their grievances in the knowledge that the organization will take 
appropriate action to address those grievances. This can be done in an informal way by verbally communicating 
the issue to the Manager or HR and then getting it addressed along with a member from the Grievance Redressal 
Committee (GRC). The other option is to submit the complaint in writing to either Manager/Business HR or posting at 
email id GrievanceCell@niit.com which is accessible by an authorized representative from the Leadership team of HR. 
There is another email ID CPO@niit.com which is directly accessed by the CHRO of the company to deal with grievance 
matters directly.
	
Yet another option is to post an Anonymous message on the Amber portal (AI powered HR Engagement portal). The link 
for this Anonymous link called ‘Anonymous Bat’ is shared with by Amber with the NIITian once s/he has completed his/
her first digital chat with Amber. This stays with the NIITian and can be used at any time during one’s association with 
NIIT. This message directly reaches the CEO and CHRO of the company.
