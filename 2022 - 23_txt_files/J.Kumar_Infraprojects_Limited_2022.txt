If yes, provide details of the same.
	
The Company has processes for management of conflict of interests involving members of the Board which may arise 
due to Directors joining the Boards of other companies, and even conflicts which could take place in the course of normal 
business activities. The process allows the Directors to recuse themselves from the discussions pertaining to the conflict 
of interest. The Directors have to exercise their responsibilities in a bona fide manner in the interests of the Company. 
They should not allow any extraneous considerations that may vitiate their exercise of objective independent judgment 
in the paramount interest of the Company and not abuse their position to the detriment of the Company for the purpose 
of gaining direct or indirect personal advantage. Any conflict of interest arising with the Board Members needs to be 
reported to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee/Chairman of the Board.

examples and actions. This forms the crux of the Live Injury-Free Each Day (L.I.F.E) goal. Management personnel 
participate in EHS meetings, conduct site inspections and Audits, to encourage and develop a positive attitude towards 
EHS within JKIL projects and operations. The Management ensure that adequate resources were available and 
responsibilities allocated for implementing the JKIL LIFE framework. Roles and responsibilities, targets and objectives, 
goals, training needs and required conduct is clearly defined, agreed and communicated across the organization.
	
We view health and safety as an important management task that requires a culture of continual improvement. Our 
projectlevel EHS team supports our operations and employees in integrating health and safety standards into their 
operational planning, business decisions, and daily process activities. Given the nature of our operations, occupational 
health and safety is always our top priority. We have established and implemented an Occupational Health and Safety 
Management System aligned to the ISO 45001:2018 standards. Our project site personnel are trained to identify, 
alleviate, and control risks specific to their operation. Health and safety-related training, awareness sessions and 
inspections are being carried out on a periodic basis.

Furthermore, to support, there is a systematic risk management process in place to identify and control hazards in 
projects/units which require verification of conformity. Therefore, a process has been established for carrying out internal 
EHS audits. This process mandates organizing internal audits for active projects, and it is verified by audit teams specific

15.	 Provide details of any corrective action taken or 
underway to address safety-related incidents (if 
any) and on significant risks/concerns arising from 
assessments of health and safety practices and

The Company’s EHS Council undertakes a review of the 
accidents and incidents, and formulates procedures 
based on risk analysis of data gathered through various 
businesses. It makes use of advanced technology such 
as vison analytics/ AI to detect any health and safety 
hazards and gather data. This data is used for predictive 
analysis, 
measurement 
of 
incidents 
and 
unsafe 
behaviors. This enables identification of the key areas 
of risk which in turn guides the projects to proactively 
manage and focus resources to prevent any accidents 
or incidents. Such analysis is shared throughout the 
group businesses structure, to support JKIL Mission 
ZERO HARM objective.
	
Efforts have been made in understanding the Company’s 
high-risk profile holistically. EHS risk management 
culture has been inculcated across the Company. Steps 
taken include:
	
•	
Implementation of HSE Surveillance Rating
	
•	
Developed HSE Training Modules on high-risk 
activities
	
•	
Developed standardized template of HSE Lessons 
Learnt (EHS Alert) and these alerts are shared in 
the centralized   knowledge sharing platform which 
can be accessed by the employees
	
•	
Inducted Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) into 
the HSES Management Community of central 
knowledge sharing module
	
•	
Inter business EHS Audits to evaluate and reinforce 
EHSMS for lateral sharing of best EHS practices.
	
•	
Implementation of Behavior Based Safety to 
reinforce positive safe behavior at workplaces and 
trends and monitor action for improvement of BBS 
culture across project sites.
	
•	
Senior Management audits based on standard 
checklist developed by the EHS Council.
	
These efforts have led to a capture of data on high-risk 
hazardous activities in JKIL’s Business verticals. This 
helps to devise an action plan to enhance the ability of 
stakeholders to manage such activities with a higher 
degree of awareness and suitable training − using 
technology such as AR/VR from external agencies as 
well as subject matter experts. Employees strive to 
achieve EHS excellence in their respective functions and 
align their actions and business decisions.

waste categories, tie-up with authorized vendors to ensure proper disposal and adherence to Environment Management 
System (ISO 14001:2015), wherever applicable.
	
For hazardous waste generated during operations, there are separate collection and storage facilities, and is disposed 
at regular intervals in line with the Central and State Pollution Control Board regulations through authorized vendors.
	
Some sites also display safety data sheets explaining handling and storage of hazardous chemicals. Disposal of hazardous 
waste is in accordance with Hazardous Waste Management Rules 2016 and State Pollution Control Board guidelines. 
The biomedical waste is disposed of with the help of authorized hospitals nearby and handed over to an authorized 
agency for treatment and disposal. Biomedical waste generation, treatment and disposal is guided by the Biomedical 
Waste Management Rules, 2016.
	
The businesses also conduct regular training and awareness Programmes on waste minimization, and management 
techniques for employees and workers responsible for waste management. In emergency situations, the Company also 
provides suitable firefighting arrangements, spill kits, and drip trays for safe handling and storage of waste materials.
	
The Company has defined processes for managing waste at each of its sites. We follow the basic principle of segregation 
of the waste at source and adopt the 3R concept of “reduce, reuse and recycle”. The hazardous wastes are handled, 
segregated, stored and transported in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and industry best practices. 
The hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmentally sound manner through authorized vendors for recycling as 
required by the regulation. The Company’s strategic intent is to reduce the generation of waste at the source level and 
divert waste from disposal through reuse and recycling wherever possible. All the sites are working towards achieving the 
Company’s commitment for zero waste-to land fill.

Initiatives undertaken
Details of the initiative (web-link, if any, 
No may be provided along with summary)
Outcome of initiative
1.
Reduction in diesel 
consumption through 
operational improvements 
Plant & Machinery (P&M) in construction 
projects primarily use diesel as power 
source. The Company has undertaken 
various operational improvement initiatives, 
e.g. increasing the utilization of P&M, 
reducing idling time, reducing fuel wastage, 
fuel budgeting for equipment, replacing 
older equipment with new ones, etc.
Estimated to help reduce 
7,547 tCO2e in emissions on 
account of optimization in diesel 
consumption. 
2.
Switching from DG to grid 
electricity for power 
Typically, construction projects use DGs as 
power source. The Company has taken the 
initiative across project sites to get grid 
connectivity and thereby reduce diesel 
consumption
Estimated to avoid 2,396 
tCO2e in emissions.
3.
Implementation of 
technologies to reduce 
consumption of materials
In highway projects, certain projects 
require rehabilitation of existing roads. 
The typical process requires new materials 
to be sourced for relaying the layers. This 
year, the Company deployed the Cold 
Central Plant Recycling technology in 
some projects to recycle material from 
existing roads, and reduce consumption of 
virgin material. Additionally, this process 
utilizes a technique which requires lower 
energy consumption compared to the Hot 
Recycling process.
Helped avoid two million tonnes 
of virgin material (aggregates). 
Helped in avoiding 10,924 
tCO2e in emissions from energy 
consumption) and 1,520 tCO2e 
in emissions from materials 
used.
