Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social matters 
that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk 
along-with its financial implications, as per the following format

Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate 
positive 
or 
negative implications)
1.
Content 
veracity
Opportunity
Lapses in the quality and 
veracity of news content have 
a negative impact on society 
at large. The weaponisation of 
fake news perversely impacts 
mass psychology and can also 
threaten democratic values.
Against this backdrop, we, as 
a media company, are deeply 
invested in delivering correct 
and comprehensive news to our 
customers. We see this as not 
only an opportunity but also an 
obligation towards society.
NA
Our 
viewers 
are 
increasingly 
resonating 
with our attempts to 
be the source of truth 
in an otherwise noisy 
environment. This fortifies 
our brand perception and 
ensures strong audience 
metrics. Resultantly, we 
see 
positive 
financial 
implications 
from 
this 
opportunity.
2.
Social impact
Opportunity
The 
Company 
believes 
in 
respect for all, justice for all. 
The starting point of good 
journalism is respect — for 
individuals and institutions. The 
Company stands up for what is 
right and demands justice for 
all citizens, especially for the 
weakest among us.
NA
Strong editorial standards 
and practices help us 
establish a distinct brand 
identity and a leadership 
position in the market.
3
Talent 
management
Risk
Talent is the key differentiator 
in 
the 
success 
of 
any 
organisation, 
however, 
for 
a 
media 
organisation, 
dependence on people for 
success 
is 
disproportionate. 
Also, with technology driving 
the rapid evolution of the 
content 
production 
and 
consumption 
patterns, 
the 
need for continuous upskilling 
is paramount for success.
The Company is executing 
multiple initiatives to attract 
and retain talent. The Company 
is taking several initiatives to 
build an ‘Employee Brand’ to 
attract good talent. 
The Company identifies the 
need for upgrading the skills 
of employees and organises 
various in- house and external 
training sessions.  The Company 
has partnered with various 
online learning platforms like 
LinkedIn 
learning, 
Coursera, 
etc. and provides unlimited 
access to over 16K online 
tutorials 
to 
its 
employees.
The availability of top 
talent remains scarce, and 
if the Company is unable 
to attract people who are 
domain experts, it might 
hamper its chances of 
success. Further, the pace 
of technological evolution 
makes it challenging to 
continuously upgrade the 
skills of employees, which 
might lead to gaps in the 
organisation’s skill matrix.

Diversity and 
inclusion
Opportunity
A diverse workforce has a direct 
and disproportionate impact 
on improving productivity and 
business performance.
NA
A 
workplace, 
teeming 
with people from diverse 
backgrounds, 
genders, 
sexual orientations, and 
geographies allows for an 
improved flow of ideas, 
innovation, 
awareness, 
and creativity, thereby 
leading 
to 
balanced 
decision-making, higher 
output, and enhanced 
reputation as well.
5.
Data 
protection
Risk
Protection of user data is crucial 
to earning consumer trust and 
preventing the misuse of data 
by unscrupulous elements.
The Company has a robust 
mechanism to safeguard user 
data.  Also, the Company 
sensitises its employees on a 
regular basis on various cyber 
security issues.
Any incident of data 
breach or cyber security 
attack 
can 
harm 
the 
Company’s 
competitive 
advantage and can make 
it vulnerable to legal 
action.
6
Business 
ethics, 
integrity and 
transparency
Risk
Ethics and integrity have always 
been the key values to acquire 
stakeholder trust, and establish 
a strong reputation. These 
elements are essential for the 
Company in order to sustain in 
the  long-term. Any deviation 
from ethical standards can 
cause business instability.
The Company has the requisite 
policies, and it imparts training 
to equip employees with the 
required understanding and 
knowledge to conduct business 
ethically and prevent, identify, 
and 
respond 
to 
violations. 
The Company has rolled out 
Whistle-Blower Policy and Anti-
Bribery and Anti-Corruption 
Policy, under which complaints 
can be made to the Ethics and 
Compliance Task Force without 
any fear of retaliation.
Non-adherence 
might 
lead to difficulties in 
dealing with concerns of 
ethics, 
non-compliance, 
and violations of the 
Company’s principles. The 
same may cause damage 
to corporate reputation.
7
Regulatory 
issues and 
compliance
Risk
It is crucial for the Company to 
maintain regulatory compliance 
to foster confidence among 
its stakeholders’ groups and 
to ensure that its operations 
are compliant with applicable 
laws in order to prevent legal 
violations.
The risk of non-compliance 
within 
the 
Company 
is 
mitigated 
by 
a 
robust 
compliance 
management 
framework. The Company has 
adopted a digitally enabled, 
comprehensive 
compliance 
management 
framework. 
Effective control and efficient 
oversight 
by 
the 
senior 
management is ensured by 
cascading 
the 
responsibility 
matrix till the last performer of 
the activity. 
Non-adherence 
to 
regulatory requirements 
can 
undermine 
stakeholder 
trust, 
damage reputation, and 
disrupt business.
