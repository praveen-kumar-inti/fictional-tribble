Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
Public hearing is a process in the environmental clearance process in which stakeholders can
interact directly about the concerns regarding an upcoming project. In this way people can express
their objections and opinions and offer suggestions on a proposed undertaking in order to influence
the decision-making process. Public participation may benefit both the proponent and affected
community, whereas if ignored it may lead to conflicts and problems for project implementation,
acceptability and sustainability.
For project proponent, public hearing is a forum to inform the entire community of the outcome
of the Environmental Assessment of proposed project, to verify the EIA findings in relation to
ground reality and confirm that stakeholders have been adequately consulted and have been part
of the decision-making processes.
