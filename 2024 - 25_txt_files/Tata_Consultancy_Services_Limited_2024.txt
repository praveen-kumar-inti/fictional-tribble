a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing42? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes. TCS Global Policy on Responsible Sourcing was released internally, during FY 2025 which combines the two existing policies 
a) TCS Green Procurement and b) TCS Sustainable Supply Chain Policy. This policy details out the topics under Labour, Human 
rights, Ethics, Environment and Sustainable Procurement. Additionally, this policy aligns with various ESG frameworks and 
regulatory requirements.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
All suppliers having a contract agreement with TCS are required to abide by the TCS’ Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC), Health, 
Safety and Environment (HSE) requirements for contractors and the applicable policies. In addition to this about 23.8% of 
suppliers have been assessed in FY 2025 on sustainability pillars including Labour, Human rights, Ethics, Environment and 
Sustainable Procurement through a Sustainable Supply Chain Assessment Platform.

This is not relevant to TCS global operations as the Company is primarily an IT services organization providing software services.
	
As the Company provides software services through its office-based operations, it procures off-the-shelf items or products, which 
after their end of life are disposed of as per sustainable waste management practices. This is in line with the concept of circularity 
through waste minimization, segregation, reuse, recycling, and eco-friendly disposal according to regulatory requirements and 
industry best practices.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing industry) or for its 
services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details in the following format?
	
No. TCS is primarily an IT services organization and products, if any, are typically software products. Hence the applicability of 
life-cycle approach to TCS’ core operations is rather limited. Application of a life cycle approach is hence restricted to the services 
and products procured by TCS for its own operations. Most of the product categories procured are off-the-shelf items. Hence, the 
life cycle philosophy as extended to these include green procurement considerations as a part of the technical specifications for 
purchase and end-of-life management to maximize recycling.
2.	
If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of your products/
services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) or through any other means, briefly describe the same 
along-with action taken to mitigate the same44.

Health and safety practices
TCS’ supply chain sustainability requirements are integrated with online procurement platform with 
the ‘Sourcing module’ and ‘Risk module’. TCS’ HSE policies, procedures, guidelines, and Supplier 
Code of Conduct (SCoC) are included in sourcing module in RFP template for digital acceptance by all 
suppliers/vendors who are considered for evaluation.
Some critical suppliers such as regulated waste disposal services (e-waste, hazardous waste, 
battery wastes), bottled water suppliers, food suppliers for cafeteria and similar suppliers undergo 
legal compliance due diligence and site inspection before initiating the negotiation process. The 
procurement team ensures that SCoC acceptance is done by vendors and all compliances are in place 
for which a tracking system is maintained.
TCS also conducts periodic audits/review of processes/documents of on-boarded vendors who have 
contractual agreement.
During FY 2025, 23.8% of suppliers have been assessed on sustainability pillars including health & 
safety through a Sustainable Supply Chain Assessment Platform.

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity 62.
	
TCS engages with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, to deepen its insights into their needs and expectations, and to develop 
sustainable strategies for the short, medium and long term. Stakeholder engagement also helps to manage risks and opportunities 
in business operations. The key stakeholders identified in consultation with the Company’s management are: customers, employees, 
shareholders, academic institutions, staffing firms, other suppliers, technology partners and collaborators, industry bodies, 
governments, NGOs, local communities, regulators and society at large.
	
Some other stakeholders that TCS closely engages with – such as industry analysts, equity analysts, and the news media are proxies 
for other named stakeholders i.e. customers, shareholders, and society at large, respectively.
	
Stakeholder interactions might be structured (e.g. surveys, account statements) or unstructured (town halls, 1x1 or group meetings). 
Based on mutual convenience and need, the engagement may be scheduled as needed, or pre-scheduled on a periodic basis, or 
ongoing (e.g. website, social media).

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics or if 
consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
TCS consults stakeholders on material topics and also conducts periodic materiality assessments to update the list on an ongoing 
basis. Stakeholder interactions result in the identification of a broad funnel of issues important to each of the constituencies. The 
Company uses discussions with internal and external stakeholders, as well as its own judgment, to prioritize and arrive at a list of 
material topics with significant economic, environmental, or social impacts on TCS’ business, reputation, and operations. The TCS 
management shares feedback with the Board on these issues.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics 
(Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated 
into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes, TCS’ ESG strategy on material topics uses inputs gathered during stakeholder consultations. Material topics are shortlisted and 
prioritized based on their impact on stakeholders and business and are included in the section titled ‘Sustainability Disclosures’, 
which forms part of this Integrated Annual Report.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/marginalized 
stakeholder groups.
	
TCS' Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is committed to build equitable and inclusive pathways for women, youth, and 
marginalized groups on a meaningful scale and with breakthrough innovations. The organization serves stakeholders in remote 
parts of the world, in areas where the need is high, and resources are the least. This is realized through programs that address 
the needs of stakeholders in the areas of K-12 education, literacy to livelihood, employment through skilling, digital inclusion and 
entrepreneurship.

PRINCIPLE 6: Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment 
Environmental Sustainability at TCS:
TCS has embraced the precautionary principle and recognized carbon footprint mitigation and environmental protection along with 
resource optimization as a key priority area. It is driven by the belief that sustainability-driven decisions are essential to business success. 
TCS’ Environmental Sustainability Policy articulates this vision and mission. The Stakeholder Relationship Committee oversees the carbon 
and environmental strategy and performance, demonstrating strong commitment at senior-most levels of the organization.
TCS is certified to ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System (EMS) standard across 129 of its facilities worldwide in FY 2025. 
These certified locations constitute 82% of office footprint and 87% of people footprint operating from these locations#. In FY 2025, 
33%  of ISO 14001 certified TCS locations underwent external/third party audits. TCS has induction training for all new employees on 
Environmental Sustainability. In addition to this, an Environmental Sustainability Web Based Training (WBT) program is mandatory for 
all employees which  includes topics such as  Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs), energy and climate change, water conservation, 
waste management, biodiversity, responsible consumerism, design thinking for sustainability and what TCS is doing in the field of 
environmental sustainability. This training is followed by bi-annual refresher training and assessment. In FY 2025, 98% employees were 
compliant with the mandatory training requirement.
Essential Indicators
1.	
Details of total energy consumption (in Joules or multiples) and energy intensity, in the following format73:
	
Electricity from the grid is the most significant form of energy for TCS. Over the years, TCS has increased the share of Renewable 
Electricity (RE) through “green-tariff ” schemes offered by the state electricity providers, onsite rooftop solar generation and 
procurement from third party producers in India and  procurement of Energy Attribute Certificates (EAC). The renewable energy 
consumption as a percentage of total energy consumption has increased from 74% in FY 2024 to 79% in FY 2025. The renewable 
electricity attributed to 85% of total electricity consumption during the year (refer to table below). Electricity consumption across 
TCS operations increased by 11% YoY on account of increased operations due to return to office and inclusion of additional locations 
in the reporting boundary. There is a 4.3% increase in overall electricity consumption due to inclusion of additional locations in the 
reporting boundary. Other sources of energy include natural gas (mainly used for space heating/cooling, district heating and cooling, 
mostly in overseas geographies), fuel used in company owned vehicles, cooking gas used in cafeteria and diesel used in diesel 
generators (mainly used as a back-up source during power shortages).

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details78.
	
Yes. TCS is executing projects related to reducing GHG emissions to meet the carbon targets. 
	
Commitment to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)
	
TCS has committed to SBTi and the Near-Term Targets are given below. SBTi has classified TCS’s scope 1 and 2 target, in line with a 
1.5°C trajectory.  
	
•	
TCS commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 90% by FY 2030 from a FY 2016 base year.  
	
•	
TCS also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 emissions 35% by FY 2034 from a FY 2020 base year. 
	
To achieve these targets, the green-house gas management approach has four key levers – green infrastructure, green IT, IT-enabled 
operational efficiencies, and renewable energy.
	
Green Infrastructure and IT enabled operational efficiency:
	
All new campuses owned by TCS are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource efficiency. They have roof-top 
solar photovoltaic installations to reduce the carbon footprint. The total built-up area occupied by TCS has increased YoY from 38.2 million 
sq.ft. to  40.6 million sq.ft. in FY 2025. With the increasing footprint, TCS is committed to expand consciously its green footprint, to align 
with its sustainability goals. In FY 2025, TCS got Platinum IGBC certification for 2 additional buildings and  Gold certification for 3 additional 
buildings. The green certified area in India has increased from 67.3% to 71% over the total built-up area.  This accounts for 45 TCS offices 
and campuses with over 28.8 million sq.ft. of area under certified green building by Indian Green Building Council.
	
During the year, several initiatives were aligned to achieve the carbon targets which included those in building and IT infrastructure. 
Initiatives in building infrastructure included energy efficiencies in HVAC systems, Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) and chillers. 
The specific initiatives are as below:
	
•	
HVAC system upgradation by installation of latest technology VRF systems which works on inverter technology.
	
•	
Use of High Efficiency VFD based chillers.
	
•	
Replacement of R-22 based and fixed compressor-based HVAC equipment with inverter technology-based equipment.
	
•	
Modular UPS which can modulate its capacity based on load and helps provide 90-95% efficiency, even at lower loads.
	
•	
Life cycle-based replacement of HVAC equipment like chillers, pumps and cooling towers has helped reduce TCS’ energy 
consumption.
	
•	
Energy optimization in the Company’s operations through iOT based solutions, remote monitoring, analytics and automated 
feedback mechanism.
	
•	
As a commitment to energy conservation and management, the Company has continued to implement initiatives, monitor 
and measure energy performance at 22 of TCS’ ISO 50001:2018 certified campuses in India, conducted internal audits at 
100% of the certified campuses and have undertaken external audits by TUV Nord for continuing TCS’ certification to Energy 
Management Systems (EnMS).
	
Green IT:
	
Initiatives in Green Information Technology (Green IT) focused on data center and IT device consolidation and optimization to reduce 
the carbon footprint. The areas covered under green IT initiatives include IT energy optimization in data centers and equipment 
rooms. TCS’ data centers have a weighted average PUE of 1.59 (FY 2025) compared to PUE of 1.7 (FY 2024). Apart from the two main 
data centers, TCS also has 54 equipment rooms for business as usual (BAU) activities, wherein the weighted average PUE was 1.79 
in FY 2025. TCS  data centres  use 100% RE. The total power consumed by  TCS data centers was 6.6 GWh  during the reporting year

FY 2025. In addition to the above, green attributes are considered in every IT asset procurement.
	
TCS’ IoT-based Real-time Energy Management System (TCS Clever Energy™) initiative involves real time monitoring to optimize 
the operational energy efficiency across all offices. The smart, scalable, analytics driven IoT solution uses TCS Connected Universe 
Platform (TCUP) IoT platform, which forms the backbone, enabling visualization of data acquired from various locations and facilities’ 
energy meters and sensors. Other energy optimization initiatives include:
	
•	
IT Equipment optimization (rack consolidation, server consolidation and procurement of energy efficient devices)
	
•	
UPS optimization (right sizing of UPS, replacement of old technology UPS with modular UPS)
	
•	
Cooling optimization (switching off excess capacity cooling units, maintaining return set temperature at 24 +/- 1° C, replacing old 
with new technology cooling units) 
	
•	
Leakage reduction (proper alignment of racks and perforated tiles, partitioning to reduce cooling area, cold aisle containment, 
blanking panel, active tiles and soft partitioning)
	
Renewable Energy:
	
The roof top solar photovoltaic installations this year remained at 10.2 MWp contributing to 2.7% of total electricity use in FY 2025. 
The Company continued its procurement of renewable energy through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), switching over to green 
tariffs and procurement of Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). The onsite solar generation and renewable energy procurement have 
resulted in an increase in renewable energy use to 79% of total energy use.

Provide details related to waste management by the entity, in the following format79:
	
TCS is primarily an IT services and consulting organization, and therefore does not use any hazardous or toxic chemicals in its 
core processes. The Company has office or facility operations, and the waste is generated from the auxiliary processes used to 
run these facilities. Based on the nature of its services, TCS’ facilities mostly generate electronic, electrical, and municipal solid 
waste. Potentially hazardous and regulated wastes such as lead-acid batteries and waste lube oil are generated in relatively smaller 
proportions which are disposed through government-approved recyclers as per regulations. E-waste is disposed to government 
approved e-waste recyclers.
	
TCS is committed to sustain the best practices that have already been institutionalized like segregation of all recyclable wastes, 
100% compliance to management practices for regulated wastes like hazardous and e-waste and maximizing recycling of office 
papers, packaging paper and plastics. TCS focuses on elimination of single-use plastics to ensure that the impact on environment and 
ecosystems is minimal. E-waste is one of key wastes generated from Company’s facilities and the Company has a process to manage 
and handle e-wastes at TCS. TCS follows a stringent process for conducting due diligence prior to finalizing an authorized e-waste 
disposal/recycling vendor. TCS facilities ensure safe disposal of the e-waste to the authorized recycler as per regulatory requirement 
in respective geographies.
	
All TCS campuses, owned offices and leased offices that have available space are provided with on-site food waste management 
facilities such as biodigesters and organic waste converters (OWCs) and garden waste is treated by vermicomposting at TCS campuses 
where feasible. TCS targets to achieve Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWL) for all TCS’ campuses by 2030 and plans to maximize the recycling 
and reuse of all waste categories to divert waste away from landfill.
	
In FY 2025, TCS has obtained ZWL certification for 8 additional campuses taking the ZWL certified campuses to 9.
	
TCS has operational control procedures (OCPs) for waste management and handling of different categories of wastes and has set 
procedures for waste segregation, handling, storage, and disposal of different waste categories.

information included in the Company’s Integrated Annual Report (but does not include the BRSR Core attributes and assurance report 
thereon). 
Additionally, we have performed a limited assurance engagement on select BRSR and GRI indicators and issued an independent assurance 
report on 27 May 2025. Our report thereon is included with the other information.
Our reasonable assurance opinion on the BRSR Core attributes does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our assurance report of the BRSR Core attributes, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the BRSR Core attributes, our knowledge obtained in the 
assurance, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that 
we obtained prior to the date of this reasonable assurance report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Intended use or purpose
The ISI and our reasonable assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR Core attributes, the 
reporting criteria and ISI and who have read the information in the ISI with reasonable diligence and understand that the ISI is prepared 
and assured at appropriate levels of materiality.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Inherent limitations 
The preparation of the Company’s BRSR information requires the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make determinations 
about the relevance of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported information.
Measurement of certain amounts with respect to the BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent 
measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG Footprint, Water Footprint, Energy Footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to 
support our opinion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics. 
Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
•	
Planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance on the sustainability disclosures in the BRSR Core are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria in line with the section above; 
•	
Forming an independent opinion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained; and
•	
Reporting our reasonable assurance opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company
Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our opinion
We exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We designed and performed 
our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion. 
The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depended on our judgement, including an assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the ISI covered by reasonable assurance, whether due to fraud or error. We identified and assessed the risks of material 
misstatement through understanding the ISI covered by reasonable assurance and the engagement circumstances. We also obtained 
an understanding of the internal control relevant to the ISI covered by reasonable assurance in order to design procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls. In carrying out 
our engagement, we:
•	
assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the Company in preparing the ISI covered by reasonable assurance; 
•	
evaluated the appropriateness of reporting policies, quantification methods and models used in the preparation of the ISI covered by 
reasonable assurance and the reasonableness of estimates made by the Company; and 
•	
evaluated the overall presentation of the ISI covered by reasonable assurance.
Exclusions
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion on the same:
•	
Any form of review of the commercial merits, technical feasibility, accuracy, compliance with applicable legislation for the project. We 
are not required to verify any of the judgements and commercial risks associated with the project, nor comment upon the possibility 
of the financial projections being achieved.
•	
The Company’s statements that describe the strategy, progress on goals (other than those listed under the scope of assurance), 
expression of opinion, claims, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim to future intention provided by the Company, and assertions related 
to Intellectual Property Rights and other competitive issues.
•	
Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in the “Scope of Assurance”.
•	
Aspects of the BRSR and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the ISI.
•	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025.
