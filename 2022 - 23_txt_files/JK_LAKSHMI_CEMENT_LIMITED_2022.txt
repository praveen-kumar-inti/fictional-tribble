a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
 
 
Yes, the Company has a sustainable sourcing policy in place. We have digital vendor registration process in place which 
mandates vendors to provide  information while registration on sustainability aspects like “Social accountability, ESG 
aspects, wastes management, ISO’s registration, etc.”. On successful completion of survey, vendors can only proceed 
further for registration.
 
b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
 
 
70% of input Raw Material sourced (i.e., Flyash / Gypsum except natural / Slag etc.), successfully eliminating the similar 
amount of requirement of virgin natural resource of raw material required for production of cement is attributable as

3. 
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, 
for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
 
We believe in "waste to wealth” and from the very beginning of the project, we adopted the “Reduce -Reuse – Recycle (3Rs) " 
principle. 
 
• 
JKLC as brand owner has applied for registration against Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) under Plastic Waste 
Management Rules, 2016 & as amended. As per EPR guidelines, we have achieved 25% target for FY 2021-22 and 70% 
target for FY 2022-23. The major product of JKLC is Cement, which is packed in cement bags. In most of the cases these bags 
are reused for construction purpose as well as for storing other items like grains, fodder etc. Plastic bags once discarded are 
also recycled by waste recyclers to make new bags. JKLC utilizes waste in form of Refused Derived Fuels (RDFs) in Co-
processing Cement Kiln. Furthermore, we have also met our targets with the help of CPCB authorized recyclers.
 
• 
Ours is a Cement product so there is no E-waste generated from the manufacturing process. However, the only E-waste 
generated is from the ofce operations and whatever E-Waste generated is being sold to the CPCB registered recyclers.
 
• 
During cement manufacturing, only used oil generated from operational machinery (hazardous waste) from our plant. 
Used oil is stored at identied best isolation locations in plant boundary which is sold to SPCB/CPCB authorized recyclers. 
Moreover, we are utilizing hazardous waste as an alternative fuel and raw materials (AFR) in our cement manufacturing 
process, generated as waste/byproduct from other industries. 
 
• 
We have adopted Vermi compost process in our plant to convert organic waste into nutrient rich Vermi compost. We 
have also used 5 years old lab tested cemented cubes to make walkway. We follow paperless processes through 
adoption of S4HANA SAP system in our work to reduce generation of paper waste. We have adopted a closed loop 
cement manufacturing process. If any case whatever waste generated from the manufacturing process, it is being 
utilized in cement manufacturing process.
4. 
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If yes, whether the 
waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control 
Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
 
Yes. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR ) is applicable to us. We have submitted the waste collection plan, which is in line 
with the EPR plan, to concerned State pollution Control Boards and Central Pollution Control Board. As per EPR guidelines, 
we have achieved 25% target for FY 2021-22 and 70% target for FY 2022-23.

Briey describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
 
• As such there is no hazardous waste generation from cement manufacturing process other than Used Oil from machinery 
operation. During cement manufacturing, only used oil generated from operational machinery (hazardous waste) from 
our plant. Used oil is stored at identied best isolation locations in plant boundary which is sold to SPCB/CPCB authorized 
recyclers. Moreover, we are utilizing hazardous waste as an alternative fuel and raw materials (AFR) in our cement 
manufacturing process, generated as waste/byproduct from other industries. 
 
• JKLC always strives to replace hazardous and toxic chemicals in our products with eco-friendly alternatives. As such, our 
products do not use any hazardous and toxic chemicals. We have also used alternative raw materials (Fly ash, Chemical 
gypsum, Granulated slag etc.) in cement production. 
 
• We believe in "waste to wealth” and from the very beginning of the project, we adopted the “Reduce -Reuse - Recycle " 
principle. Separate bins with labels are placed at dedicated points in the plant for waste collection and then according to 
the type of the waste, we will proceed for its reuse and recycling.
We have also implemented below Best Practices for Better Waste Management in our plant.
Waste Name 
Best Practice
Organic Waste/ Food  
Food Waste Indication board placed at canteen is being used to sensitize employees
Waste / Plantation Waste 
about the importance of food and minimize the wastage of food. We collect organic waste 
 
like food waste, plantation waste etc., and then use in our in-house developed vermi 
 
compost system to make organic compost in our plant.
Construction Waste/   
Utilization of lab tested cement cubes in making of roads and landscape structures.
Tested Cement Cubes 
Used oil 
We reuse the used oil in oiling and greasing of various mechanical parts and left one is sold it 
 
to the CPCB authorized vendors.
Discarded Single Use  
Utilization of discarded single use plastic bottles and drums in plantation activities.
Plastic Bottles
Paper Waste 
Adopting paperless processes such as online issue voucher & PR system, Work permit system, 
 
Safety Audit etc. We reuse paper waste in in-house developed vermi compost system.
Metal Waste 
We sell the metal waste to the authorized recycler for recycling purpose.
Liquid Waste/ Sewage/ 
The only liquid waste which is generated in our plant is sewage. Our plant is ZERO LIQIUD
Wastewater 
DISCHARGE UNIT. We collect and treat wastewater through Sewage Treatment Plants and then 
 
this treated water is being utilized in greenbelt development activities in our plant.
Co-processing 
Utilization of wastes such as POP, y ash, Chemical Gypsum (hazardous waste), y ash, etc. which 
 
are generated in other industries. So, by utilizing it, we are reducing the burden on the landll.  
Cow Dung Flowerpot  
In nurseries, conventionally plastic bags are used to grow plant saplings. There are many 
Machine 
disadvantages associated with plastic bags like not being bio-degradable, having nil porosity, 
 
and hence not being ecofriendly. Moreover, after germination, the bag has to be torn off to 
 
facilitate root growth and in case the bag is not torn properly the plant gets damaged. The 
 
cow dung pots decompose to provide the necessary nutrients for plants such as nitrogen, 
 
phosphorous and potassium.
