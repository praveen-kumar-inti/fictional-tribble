Risk 
and 
Oppor-
tunity
As a Risk: Consistent availa-
bility of skilled labour, reten-
tion of such employees and 
ensuring optimum productivi-
ty all year round
As an Opportunity: The right 
mix of employees – gender, 
demographics and skillset 
can result in a vibrant and 
self-sustaining culture that 
can drive productivity and 
help the employees generate 
job satisfaction and wealth 
for themselves.
At Apex, we begin with 
ensuring that we have the 
right person for the right 
job. They are then put 
through our strong training 
programs to ensure that 
they are equipped with 
the right skills to discharge 
their job and excel in their 
roles.
Negative
Inadequate hiring and retention 
practices can lead to decreased 
productivity and increased 
costs and also result in a loss of 
business.
Positive
Creating a viable work environ-
ment will contribute to long-
term business success and will 
also help position Apex as an 
employer of repute and create 
a virtuous cycle of attracting 
good talent.

Risk
Effective management of 
climate risk is crucial for the 
progress of the communi-
ty that we operate in and 
ultimately the ability of the 
Company to continue its op-
erations at an optimum level. 
While the business is sub-
ject to vagaries of nature, 
several steps are taken to 
ensure that the ecological 
balance of the areas we 
work in are maintained, 
including safeguards and 
best practices to create a 
sustainable business model.
Failing to effectively maintain 
ecological balance could result 
in long-term sustainability 
problems for both our business 
and the communities in which 
we operate, potentially leading 
to revenue loss or operational 
disruptions

Com-

Devel-
opment
Oppor-
tunity
Community presents a sig-
nificant opportunity for our 
business, especially given our 
labor-intensive processes. By 
hiring from the areas close to 
our operations, we not only 
create job opportunities but 
also foster sustainable com-
munity development.

Product 
Quality
Oppor-
tunity
We have invested in creat-
ing strong processes around 
Quality Checks, some of 
which are driven by reg-
ulatory requirements. This 
creates an entry barrier 
since some of the pre-quali-
fications for selling in specific 
geographies are extremely 
stringent
NA
Superior product quality leads 
to consumer stickiness and 
strengthens relationships with 
clients. Also, it gives them a 
vote of confidence to buy more 
products, which leads to healthy 
and sustainable revenues 
5
Supply 
Chain 
Man-
agement
Risk
Dependence on external 
suppliers for raw material, 
procurement of containers 
for export, has a likelihood 
to disrupt the supply of the 
products of the Company, 
resulting in lower sales.
While we are able to work 
on our supply chain for raw 
materials through constant 
interactions with farmers, 
we are exposed to supply 
chain risks on the delivery 
side. Given the delicate 
geopolitical balance on 
several of our key routes, 
disruptions could lead to 
increased costs and una-
vailability of timely supply 
to customers and inventory 
buildups.
If we are unable to secure 
raw materials in the sizes we 
require, or are unable to make 
timely shipments of our fin-
ished products, it could have a 
material adverse impact on our 
results of operations and could 
increase our costs and thereby 
impact our profitability.
