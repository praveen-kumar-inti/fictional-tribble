Business 
conduct & 
compliance
Risk
Acknowledging the importance 
of ethical behaviour and 
regulatory compliance is 
important for avoiding 
negative legal outcomes, and 
losing stakeholder trust.
•	
Developing and 
enforcing a robust code 
of conduct outlining 
expected behaviours
•	
Providing regular 
training on compliance 
with relevant laws and 
regulations
•	
Implementing 
internal controls to 
monitor adherence to 
compliance standards
•	
Establishing reporting 
mechanisms for 
employees to raise 
concerns about 
unethical behaviour
Negative: 
Non-compliance with 
laws and regulations 
may result in hefty 
fines and legal 
expenses.
6.
Business 
continuity
Risk
Healthcare services are 
essential in nature, and 
disruptions can impact 
patient care, staff safety, and 
operational efficiency. Given 
the unpredictable nature of 
disasters, whether natural, 
technological, or human-
induced, hospitals must be 
prepared to maintain critical 
operations to ensure the 
well-being of patients and the 
community.
•	
Leveraging the 
comprehensive Utility 
Management and 
Disaster Management 
Plan outlining 
procedures for 
maintaining essential 
services during 
emergencies
•	
Conducting regular risk 
assessments to identify 
potential threats and 
vulnerabilities
Negative:
Inadequate business 
continuity planning 
for JLHL can lead 
to substantial 
financial losses from 
downtime, decreased 
patient volume, 
and operational 
inefficiencies. 
7.
Data security 
& privacy
Risk
Given the sensitivity of 
patients’ data, healthcare 
services are particularly 
vulnerable to potential 
data theft and security 
breaches. These threats not 
only compromise patient 
confidentiality but also 
undermine trust in the 
healthcare system, highlighting 
the need for robust measures 
to safeguard patient 
information.
•	
Establishing a 
comprehensive group-
wide policy to address 
security threats
•	
Incorporating board 
oversight and 
committees dedicated to 
monitoring and tracking 
threats
•	
Conducting periodic 
assessments to identify 
potential vulnerabilities
Negative: 
The loss of sensitive 
data concerning 
patients, company 
information, 
and operational 
procedures can lead 
to regulatory fines, 
legal fees, and costs 
associated with 
data recovery and 
remediation.
Sr. 
no.
Material 
issue 
identified
Indicate 
whether 
risk or

In case of risk, approach to 
adapt or mitigate
Financial 
implications of the 
risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive 
or negative 
implications)
2.
Access to 
healthcare
Opportunity
Improved access not only 
fuels public health outcomes 
and drives innovation in 
medical technology but also 
stimulates economic growth 
by reducing healthcare costs 
and absenteeism. Moreover, 
delivering world-class, 
high-quality treatment with 
stringent cost optimisation for 
the underprivileged population 
further strengthens its 
significance.
-
Positive: 
Increase in the 
healthcare by 
expanding the reach 
of JLHL’s operations.
3.
Process 
safety & 
quality
Risk
Ensuring mitigation of 
regulatory penalties, 
reputational damage, and 
customer harm. Neglecting 
these standards can lead to 
legal liabilities, loss of trust, 
and financial repercussions, 
underscoring the critical need 
for robust adherence to best 
practices.
• 	 Establishing a Jupiter 
Hospital Governance 
Framework that 
promotes accreditation 
by NABH (National 
Accreditation Board for 
Hospitals & Healthcare 
Providers)
•	
Enhancing healthcare 
quality and safety across 
all locations
Negative: 
Negative perceptions 
regarding safety 
and service quality 
at JLHL can lead to 
reduced revenue, 
potential market share 
loss, lower patient 
volume, and increased 
marketing expenses 
to rebuild trust, 
ultimately straining 
the Company’s 
finances.
4.
Corporate 
governance
Risk
Recognising strong corporate 
governance fosters trust 
among stakeholders, ensures 
regulatory compliance, and 
upholds ethical standards. This 
proactive approach safeguards 
the hospital’s reputation, 
enhances operational 
efficiency, and fortifies its 
financial resilience amid 
evolving market dynamics.
•	
Implementing 
comprehensive 
corporate governance 
frameworks
•	
Establishing transparent 
policies and procedures
•	
Conducting regular 
audits to ensure 
compliance
•	
Fostering a culture 
of integrity and 
accountability
•	
Guaranteeing diversity 
in board to oversee 
governance practices
Negative:
Inadequate corporate 
governance may 
lead to regulatory 
fines, legal liabilities, 
damaged reputation, 
decreased investor 
confidence, and 
ultimately financial 
losses due to 
reduced patient trust, 
diminished revenues, 
and increased 
operational costs to 
rectify governance 
deficiencies.

Statement by the director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
In the pursuit of its business responsibility, JLHL acknowledges the imperative to address Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) challenges while striving for sustainable growth. The Hospital’s commitment to environmental stewardship is evident in 
initiatives like the adoption of renewable energy sources, exemplified by its investment in wind turbines for Thane and Pune 
hospitals. Moreover, the Hospital’s participation in the Indo-Swiss Building Energy Efficiency Project underscores its dedication to 
energy-efficient infrastructure, recognised with the NEERMAN Award 2022.
Water resource management, waste reduction, and sustainable sourcing are integral facets of JLHL’s sustainability journey. Its 
Zero Liquid Discharge systems and responsible waste management practices exemplify the Company’s dedication to minimising 
environmental impact. Additionally, its stringent supplier approval process ensures adherence to ethical and environmental 
standards.
To ensure social responsibility, JLHL prioritises stakeholder welfare, exemplified through continuous learning initiatives for 
employees and inclusive healthcare provisions for economically challenged communities. The Company’s commitment to 
transparency and effective governance, as demonstrated by its robust corporate policies and distinct board oversight committees, 
further underscores its dedication to responsible business practices.

Energy 
efficiency
Opportunity
Implementing energy efficient 
measures, JLHL not only 
reduces its environmental 
footprint but also achieves 
tangible benefits through 
lower energy consumption 
and costs. These initiatives are 
aligned with the overarching 
objectives of sustainability and 
operational efficiency.
-
Positive:
Investing in energy 
projects reduces 
energy costs, thereby 
positively impacting 
profits. Lower 
expenses resulting 
from efficiency 
initiatives enhance 
financial performance, 
demonstrating 
responsible resource 
management.
9.
Water stress
Risk
Addressing this risk is 
imperative to ensure 
sustainable water management 
and the uninterrupted 
operation of the hospital.
•	
Investing in water 
recycling and reuse 
systems to reduce 
reliance on freshwater 
sources
•	
Educating staff on 
water-saving practices 
and encouraging 
responsible water usage 
throughout the hospital. 
Additionally, domestic 
waste water is treated 
and reused for non-
contact purposes like 
flushing, gardening, and 
hospital internal road 
cleaning
Negative:
Scarcity or disruptions 
in the water supply 
can lead to increased 
costs associated with 
sourcing alternative 
water sources and 
implementing 
emergency measures. 
Additionally, there 
may be potential fines 
for non-compliance 
with water regulations.

for cooling needs.
	
•	
Use of condenser for reheating in air AHUs.
	
•	
All common washrooms and changing rooms are equipped with Automatic Lighting Control.
	
•	
Installation of windmills to reduce JLHL’s dependence on the grid for electricity has reduced our GHG emissions by 
5385.95 MT CO2e in the current year and 4813.10 MT CO2e in the previous year.
