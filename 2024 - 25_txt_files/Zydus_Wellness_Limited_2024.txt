or

(R/O)
Rationale for 
identifying the risk / 
opportunity
In case of risk, approach to 
adapt or mitigate
Financial 
implications of the 
risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative 
implications)
1.
Plastic 
& Waste 
Management
Opportunity Increasing regulatory 
pressure and consumer 
demand for sustainable 
packaging make 
transition to recyclable 
plastic a key opportunity 
to enhance brand value 
and market positioning.
Zydus Wellness aims to shift from 
multi-material to fully recyclable 
plastic by 2027, targeting zero 
waste to landfill across sites 
and reducing 1,000 tons of 
packaging waste in three years.
Positive: Reduction in 
long-term compliance 
costs, enhanced 
brand reputation, 
and consumer trust. 
Potential savings from 
waste reduction and 
improved packaging 
efficiency.
2.
Energy 
& GHG 
Emissions
Both (R/O)
Rising energy 
costs, evolving 
climate regulations, 
and stakeholder 
expectations present 
both risks and an 
opportunity for cost 
reduction and brand 
enhancement via 
sustainable operations.
The Company has established 
ambitious goals for the year 2030 
compared to the base line year 
CY 2022:
- Reduction of GHG Emission in 
Direct Operations by 50% by 
2030.
- Energy Saving of 50% by 2030 
through Process Optimization & 
Efficiency improvement.
- Increasing the contribution of 
Renewable Energy to 50% of 
total requirement, by 2030.
Positive: Long-term 
cost savings from 
renewable energy, 
potential eligibility for 
green finance.
Negative: Initial 
capex and risk of non-
compliance if targets 
are missed.

3.
Water 
Management
Both (R/O)
Increasing water 
scarcity and stress on 
local water sources 
could disrupt operations 
and pose regulatory 
risks.
Committed to 25% reduction 
in water intensity by 2030 
vs base year 2022 and Zero 
Liquid Discharge (“ZLD”) 
implementation across all sites. 
Achieved ZLD at 3 out of 4 sites; 
savings in groundwater and 
surface water consumption 
noted.
Positive: Improved 
operational resilience 
and compliance. 
Negative: Upfront 
investment in 
water treatment 
and recycling 
infrastructure.
4.
Diversity, 
Inclusion & 
Employee 
Well-being
Opportunity A diverse and inclusive 
workforce improves 
innovation and 
performance. Rising 
employee expectations 
on work-life balance, 
safety, and well-being 
necessitate strategic 
focus to attract and 
retain talent.
Zydus Wellness has increased 
female participation in key units 
(14.3% in leadership roles); 
launched Health & Wellness 
Policy, provided free health 
check-ups, and invested in 
leadership development 
programs.
Positive: Improved 
employee productivity, 
reduced attrition, 
stronger employer 
brand; also, 
recognition as a 
“Great Place to Work” 
supports long-term 
human capital 
sustainability.
5.
Data Privacy 
& Cyber 
Security
Both (R/O)
Growing reliance on 
digital platforms and 
e-commerce makes data 
breaches and cyber-
attacks a significant 
operational and 
reputational risk.
Implemented security tools and 
systems to prevent unauthorized 
access, ensured zero data 
breaches in FY 2024-25, and 
maintains regular IT audits and 
awareness trainings.
Positive: Zero 
incidents reduce risk 
exposure and help 
maintain consumer 
and partner trust. 
Negative: In case of 
breach, high financial 
and legal penalties.
6.
Corporate 
Governance 
& 
Compliance
Both (R/O)
Any gaps in governance 
or ethical misconduct 
can severely impact 
brand reputation, 
investor trust, and legal 
standing.
Maintaining strong governance 
structure with independent 
Board, ESG committee oversight, 
and ISO/FSSC certifications; 
updated all internal policies to 
align with ESG expectations.
Positive: Strong 
governance improves 
investor confidence.
Negative: Non-
compliance can 
result in penalties or 
shareholder activism.
7.
Customer 
Grievance 
Management
 Opportunity In the competitive 
FMCG sector, effective 
grievance management 
is essential to retain 
consumer trust, improve 
product quality, 
and uphold brand 
reputation. Prompt 
resolution also supports 
regulatory compliance 
and enhances 
consumer confidence.
Implementing a robust, 
transparent grievance redressal 
mechanism; tracking metrics 
such as Customer Complaints 
Per Million Packs (“CCPMP”) 
and Customer Satisfaction Index 
(“CSI“).
Positive: Reduces 
healthcare and 
litigation costs, 
improves customer 
loyalty, strengthens 
brand value, and 
identifies areas for 
product improvement.

energy sources, we’ve committed to a 25-year deal to generate 2MW of solar power at 
our Aligarh plant, a significant step towards reducing our carbon footprint and promoting 
clean energy. Further, we are in the process of signing similar agreements. Our total 
energy consumption has decreased by 9% primarily driven by higher operational 
efficiencies and energy conservation measures across the manufacturing - supply chain. 
Furthermore, a significant 40% reduction in non-renewable fuel usage exemplifies our 
commitment to transition to renewable sources of energy. 
Building on our Sustainability agenda, we have evaluated biodiversity-related risks and 
opportunities across all our manufacturing units—Aligarh, Ahmedabad, and Sikkim. This 
assessment has enabled us to identify critical gaps in our surrounding ecosystems, along 
with understanding the influence of our operations on, and their dependence upon, 
nature.
To further strengthen our ESG governance, we have implemented a suite of ESG-focused 
policies and frameworks.
Our latest Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) reflects our integrated 
sustainability approach—highlighting key efforts to reduce our environmental footprint, 
promote diversity and inclusion, and maintain high standards of ethical conduct. From 
carbon footprint reduction efforts to community engagement and social equity initiatives, 
we continue to drive impact through innovation and collaboration.
For Zydus Wellness, Sustainability is not just a strategic priority; it is central to our long-
term success and our responsibility to people and the planet. As we scale our operations, 
we remain focused on creating shared value for all stakeholders and contributing 
meaningfully to a resilient, inclusive, and low-carbon future.

Recognizing the growing importance of sustainability in procurement, we are committed to integrating Sustainable 
Sourcing performance factors into our vendor selection process going forward.
	
As part of our initial assessment, we rolled out an ESG Vendor assessment checklist to our top 34 critical vendors, selected 
based on material criticality and business volume. These vendors collectively account for 29.0% of our total vendor value. 
The responses revealed that all of the milk collection centres are certified by the FSSAI. Further all the vendors are certified by 
applicable quality standards, EHS standards and compliance requirements like FSSC 22000, ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015,
ISO 45001:2018, Kosher, Halal, SGS Non-GMO IP Supply Chain Standards etc.
	
We aim to expand this ESG assessment to 100% of our critical vendors to ensure broader coverage and stronger adherence 
to sustainable sourcing practices.
	
To uphold responsible business conduct, we have adopted a “Code of Conduct for Vendors”, outlining the minimum 
standards expected from all our partners. This code is publicly accessible on our website: https://www.zyduswellness.
com/investor/code-of-conduct-for-vendors-feb-2025.pdf. Additionally, we leverage an electronic bidding platform to 
procure high-quality materials at competitive prices, supporting our commitment to long-term sustainable sourcing.
