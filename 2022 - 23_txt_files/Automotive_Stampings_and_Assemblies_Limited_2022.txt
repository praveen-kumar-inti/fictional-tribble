Risk
•
Employee productivity and well-
being are crucial to the success

•
It is our Company’s overarching 
responsibility 
to

Circular 
Economy
Opportunity
•
 •
We see the concept of circular 
economy as highly valuable 
as 
it 
provides 
sustainable 
approach to resource utilization 
and 
waste 
management 
enabling cost savings and 
resource efficiency.
Embracing circular economy 
allows us to minimize the 
environmental 
impacts 
associated 
with 
resource 
extraction, manufacturing, and 
disposal.
NA
Positive-
Closing the loop limits the 
wastage of essential resources 
and 
leads 
to 
reduced 
dependence on raw materials, 
lower carbon emissions and 
cost savings.

Climate Action
Risk 
•
•
	
Exposure 
to 
climate-related 
risks 
and 
opportunities 
affect 
Company’s 
long-term 
operations 
and 
financial 
sustainability. 
If the Company does not 
measure, monitor, and reduce 
emissions, 
it 
can 
attract 
regulations such as carbon tax. 
• We have adopted 
measures 
to 
reduce our carbon 
emissions 
and 
invested in initiatives 
such as renewable 
energy 
sources, 
energy 
efficiency 
and 
switched 
to 
battery 
operated 
forklifts.
Positive & Negative-Transition 
to low-carbon economy offers 
multiple 
opportunities 
for 
venturing into new markets 
and cost savings. Exposure to 
climate-related physical and 
transition risks can impact the 
sustainability and long-term 
value creation of the Company.

challenges, targets, and achievements (listed 
entity has flexibility regarding the placement of

We are committed to integrate Environmental, 
Social and Governance aspects into our goals 
and vision to sustainability. With the growing 
emphasis on sustainability in the auto ancillary 
sector, we have witnessed the emergence of new 
trends and practices that demand the producers 
to be mindful of their carbon footprint. At ASAL, 
we are actively working towards reducing our 
CO2 emissions by implementing smarter and 
more efficient advancements in technology and 
renewable energy.  We are inculcating energy 
efficiency measures within our operations such 
as converting diesel operated to battery operated 
equipment, energy-efficient lighting, energy star 
certifications, energy management system and 
energy audits. Moving forward, we are determined 
to enhance our existing practices through process 
improvements, enhanced data collection on ESG 
factors, and regular audits to obtain relevant 
certifications. Our goal is to continually improve 
our sustainability performance and contribute to 
more environmentally responsible and socially 
conscious business approach.
