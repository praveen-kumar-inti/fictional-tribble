Refurbishment of 80TPH High Pressure boiler with latest 
design of bed coils & modifications in air feeding system.
 
 
Heating boiler direct DM water through waste heat 
recovery from Ethyl plant
 
 
Installed Degasser Tower in existing DM plant system to 
reduces anionic load to increase OBR value
 
 
Reusing the final Regeneration water & online 
Conductivity meter water as a RO water, this will save 
approx. 12 KL of Ro water daily which leads to saving of 
approx. 480 KL of Raw water per month
 
 
Replaced our old in-efficient DG Set with a new DG Set of 
625KVA having higher efficiency and better cooling.
 
 
Installed Heat reject ducts VFD in different rooms such as 
55T control room, 291/344TR machine VFD rooms. Excess 
heat is directly vented out thereby decreasing the heat 
load on Air Conditioner and improving its efficiency.
 
 
Installation of VFD’s on ETP AHR blowers which are 
continuously running. Hence, power savings are 
generated by reducing their rpms and loading.
 
 
Hazardous waste reduction, recycling, and reuse 
work processes.

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (Contd..)
 
It was not part of our engagement to review product- or service-related information, references 
to external information sources, expert opinions and future-related statements in the Report. 
Responsibility of the Company 
The legal representatives of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the sustaina-
bility information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. This responsibility includes in par-
ticular the selection and use of appropriate methods for sustainability reporting, the collection 
and compilation of information and the making of appropriate assumptions or, where appropri-
ate, the making of appropriate estimates. Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsi-
ble for necessary internal controls to enable the preparation of a sustainability report that is 
free of material - intentional or unintentional - erroneous information. 
Verification methodology and procedures performed 
The verification engagement has been planned and performed in accordance with the verifi-
cation methodology developed by the TÜV SÜD Group which is based upon the ISO 17029 
and ISAE 3000.  
The applied level of assurance was “limited assurance”. Because the level of assurance ob-
tained in a limited assurance, as the engagement is a limited reasonable assurance engage-
ment, the procedures the verification team performs in a limited assurance engagement vary 
in nature and timing from, a reasonable assurance engagement.  
The verification was based on a systematic and evidence-based assurance process limited as 
stated above. The selection of assurance procedures is subject to the auditor’s own judgment. 
The procedures included amongst others: 
- 
Inquiries of personnel who are responsible for the stakeholder engagement under materi-
ality analysis to understand the reporting boundaries 
- 
Evaluation of the design and implementation of the systems and processes for compiling, 
analysing, and aggregating sustainability information as well as for internal controls 
- 
Inquiries of company’s representatives responsible for collecting, preparing and consoli-
dating sustainability information and performing internal controls 
- 
Analytical procedures and inspection of sustainability information as reported at group 
level by all locations 
- 
Assessment of local data collection and management procedures and control mecha-
nisms through a sample survey at plant located at Company’s Plant at Barnala (Punjab) 
and Corporate Office at Ludhiana (Punjab) 
Conclusion 
On the basis of the assessment procedures carried out from 15.05.2024 to 24.07.2024, Noth-
ing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the completeness with 
respect the Reporting Criteria. 
Limitations 
The assurance process was subject to the following limitations: 
- 
The subject matter information covered by the engagement are described in the “scope of 
the engagement”. Assurance of further information included in the sustainability reporting 
was not performed. Accordingly, TÜV SÜD do not express a conclusion on those infor-
mation. 
- 
Financial data were only considered to the extent to check the compliance with the eco-
nomic indicators provided by the GRI Standards and were drawn directly from inde-
pendently audited financial accounts. TÜV SÜD did not perform any further assurance pro-
cedures on data, which were subject of the annual financial audit.

- 
The assurance scope excluded forward-looking statements, product- or service-related in-
formation, external information sources and expert opinions. 
Use of this Statement 
The Company must reproduce the TÜV SÜD statement and possible attachments in full and 
without omissions, changes, or additions. 
This statement is by the scope of the engagement solely intended to inform the Company as 
to the results of the mandated assessment. TÜV SÜD has not considered the interest of any 
other party in the selected sustainability information, this assurance report or the conclusions 
TÜV SÜD has reached. Therefore, nothing in the engagement or this statement provides third 
parties with any rights or claims whatsoever.  
Independence and competence of the verifier 
TÜV SÜD South Asia Pvt Ltd. is an independent certification and testing organization and 
member of the international TÜV SÜD Group, with accreditations also in the areas of social 
responsibility and environmental protection. The assurance team was assembled based on 
the knowledge, experience and qualification of the auditors. TÜV SÜD South Asia Pvt Ltd 
hereby declares that there is no conflict of interest with the Company.
