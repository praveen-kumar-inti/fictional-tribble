opportunity
In case of risk, approach to adapt 
or mitigate
Financial implications of the 
risk or opportunity
(Indicate positive or negative 
implications)
1
Product 
Quality and 
Safety
Risk
In the tire industry, product failures 
can lead to serious safety issues, 
recalls, 
and 
substantial 
financial 
damage. Maintaining high-quality and 
safe products is critical to protecting 
consumers and the company’s market 
position.
We adhere to stringent quality 
control measures and conduct regular 
product testing to prevent defects.
We 
also 
follow 
product 
safety 
practices to ensure that top-tier 
standards are met or exceeded.
Negative; product recalls and 
safety failures are costly and can 
severely impact customer trust 
and company reputation.
2
Water 
Stewardship
Risk
Water 
scarcity 
and 
poor 
water 
management practices can lead to 
conflicts with local communities, 
regulatory penalties, and increased 
operational costs.
We have implemented water-efficient 
technologies 
and 
wastewater 
recycling 
to 
reduce 
freshwater 
usage such as ETP, STP, MEE and RO 
reject reuse. We will also engage 
stakeholders 
in 
water-stressed 
regions to collaboratively manage 
shared water resources, enhancing 
community relations and securing 
operational stability.
Negative; 
inadequate 
water 
management 
can 
disrupt 
operations and additional costs 
for 
water 
procurement 
and 
compliance 
with 
emerging 
regulations.
3
Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Governance 
issues 
can 
lead 
to 
significant 
non-compliance 
risks, 
affecting investor confidence and 
legal standing. The tire industry, 
being highlyA regulated, requires 
stringent 
governance 
to 
uphold 
ethical standards and operational 
transparency.
We plan to further amplify board 
oversight by regular training and 
internal audits, ensuring alignment 
with global governance standards. We 
will also Implement robust internal 
controls and compliance monitoring 
systems 
manage 
and 
mitigate 
governance risks efficiently.
Negative; poor governance can 
lead to regulatory fines, eroding 
investor trust and potentially 
impacting 
market 
value 
negatively.
4
Emissions 
Management
Risk & Opportunity
With 
energy 
saving 
initiatives, 
renewable energy initiatives, process 
optimisation and overall operations 
efficiency 
and 
logistic 
network 
optimisation initiatives, the Company 
shall be able to optimise its energy 
consumption and reduce carbon 
emissions.
We are currently in the process of 
calculating our Scope 3 emissions. 
We have also deployed air pollution 
control and monitoring devices to 
reduce and track fugitive emissions for 
continuous monitoring and reporting 
Negative; With energy saving 
initiatives and efforts to mitigate, 
manage 
and 
minimise 
the 
emissions are expected to have 
positive financial implications.

Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Efficient 
energy 
management 
reduces 
operational 
costs 
and 
minimizes 
environmental 
impact, 
aligning with global shifts towards 
energy sustainability and providing a 
competitive edge.
We have invested in energy-efficient 
technologies and renewable energy 
sources to reduce reliance on fossil 
fuels. 
We also plan to adopt best practices 
for energy management, viz. ISO 
50001 standard, to optimize energy 
use and reduce costs.
Positive; 
effective 
energy 
management not only reduces 
costs but also improves the 
company’s 
sustainability 
profile, attracting eco-conscious 
investors and customers.
6
Sustainable 
Strategy 
for Climate 
Resilience
Opportunity
Adapting to climate change by 
developing resilient products and 
processes positions the company as 
a leader in sustainability, attracting 
investments and customers.
We plan to innovate and deploy new 
tires that are adaptable to varying 
climatic conditions. We are investing 
in research and development focused 
on reducing the carbon footprint of 
production processes and products. 
We will also enhance operational 
flexibility to respond to weather-
related disruptions. We are conducting 
climate change risk assessment for 
enhancing our strategy for climate 
resilience 
Positive; 
proactive 
climate 
adaptation measures can lead 
to operational efficiencies, open 
new markets, and enhance brand 
loyalty, positively impacting the 
bottom line.
7
Business 
Ethics and 
Compliance
Risk
The Company expects all its employees 
to adhere to the Code of Conduct 
Policy  and Ethical behaviour. The 
Company follows zero tolerance for 
any non-compliance in this regard.
We have a very stringent Code of 
Conduct Policy which ensures ethical 
behaviour 
and 
compliance 
with 
applicable laws and regulations. The 
said policy provides for framework for 
employees and other stakeholders to 
ensure that business is governed only 
by ethical practices.
Negative implication. The failure 
to adhere to code of conduct 
will have a negative reputational 
impact on our employees and all 
the stakeholders
8
Innovation 
and 
Digitalization
Opportunity
Embracing digital transformation and 
innovation can significantly enhance 
operational 
efficiencies, 
customer 
engagement, and open new revenue 
streams.
We have prioritized investments in 
R&D and digital technologies that 
streamline operations and improve 
product 
development 
processes. 
This will help us foster a culture of 
innovation to sustain competitive 
advantage. 
We 
will 
also 
adapt 
strategies to integrated advanced 
analytics and IoT technology to 
enhance 
our 
manufacturing 
and 
supply chain operations.
Positive; 
investments 
in 
digitalization 
typically 
yield 
high returns through improved 
market positioning and customer 
satisfaction
9
Waste 
management 
& Circular 
Economy
Opportunity
Overall 
operational 
efficiency, 
adherence 
to 
the 
compliances 
with resource efficiency result in 
reduction in creation of waste and its 
management in a better manner to 
have lesser impact on environment.
Across the operations, we are working 
towards reducing the environmental 
impact of waste generated. We 
are 
driving 
waste 
management 
programmes through tie-ups with 
various recyclers who collect, process, 
and dispose our waste in accordance 
with relevant guidelines.
Positive 
Managing waste at each stage of 
the manufacturing process has 
direct impact on achieving the 
resource efficiency and together 
with compliance of all the 
applicable regulations can have 
positive financial impact
10
Ethical 
Procurement
Risk
Ethical 
breaches 
in 
procurement 
can lead to legal penalties and 
reputational damage, especially in 
industries like tire manufacturing 
where material sourcing is under 
scrutiny for labour and environmental 
practices.
We 
have 
established 
strict 
procurement policies that enforce 
compliance with ethical standards, 
including 
third-party 
certifications 
and audits.
We will also leverage industry best 
practices for ethical procurement 
to 
enhance 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
within 
the 
supply 
chain.
Negative; ethical lapses could 
result in regulatory fines and loss 
of business credibility, impacting 
financial performance adversely.
11
Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk
The complexity and global span of 
tire industry supply chains expose 
companies to significant sustainability 
and 
disruption 
risks, 
impacting 
operational continuity and compliance 
with environmental regulations.
We aim to develop a resilient supply 
chain 
framework 
by 
diversifying 
suppliers and integrating sustainability 
criteria into supplier selection. We will 
also implement transparent supply 
chain practices to ensure compliance 
with 
environmental 
and 
social 
standards, thereby reducing potential 
risks.
Negative; disruptions or non-
compliance in the supply chain 
can lead to increased costs 
and damage to the brand’s 
reputation.
