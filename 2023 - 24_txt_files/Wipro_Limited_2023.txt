LEADERSHIP INDICATORS 
1. 	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, 
and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the 
Board. 
The consultation with the Board on key stakeholder concerns is largely mediated by different organizational functions 
which are responsible for the respective stakeholders. Periodic Board reviews are held at least once a quarter, during 
which the Board holds extensive discussions with the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and other senior leaders 
representing these functions. For example, feedback on customer trends and issues is provided by the Heads of 
Businesses and Market Units, that on investors by the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and his team, on employees by 
the Chief Human Resources Officer (“CHRO”) and his team, on sustainability issues by the Chief Sustainability Officer, 
etc. Please refer to “Engagement Mode and Frequency” and “Topics of Engagement” in the “Stakeholder Engagement” 
Section of Wipro Annual Report for FY 2023-24.
2. 	 Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, 
and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders 
on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity. 
Yes, stakeholder engagement covers key material issues driven by strategic objectives through various modes of 
engagements. There is a primary internal custodian for each stakeholder group. For example, feedback from employees 
involve certain informed steps which are taken leading to enhanced communications and collaboration forums. For 
suppliers, this has improved the ease of doing business and ability to address environmental and social aspects. For 
communities, under the community ecology initiative, we focus on striking an ecological balance in our proximate 
communities by taking up projects that have direct and tangible benefits and strengthening our urban primary 
healthcare system is a focus area for us. This is because vulnerable communities still lack adequate personnel and 
amenities for their healthcare needs. Similarly, for employees, at Wipro, the health, safety, and wellbeing of our 
employees is of paramount importance. We look at wellbeing holistically, connecting mind, body, and community to 
help us focus on being healthy, feeling happy, and living our life’s purpose. Our employee wellness programs encompass 
three areas of employee wellbeing: Physical, emotional, and financial. Inputs are received through the employee 
feedback mechanism. Customer surveys are conducted periodically to get customer inputs. Additionally, Quarterly 
reviews are held with customers where inputs are sought.

Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups. 
Wipro engages with communities and civil society networks to work on systemic issues that can act as force multipliers 
for social transformation and sustainable development. Within this ambit, we deliberatively focus on disadvantaged 
groups in a significant majority of our social initiatives e.g. Children with Disability, the Urban Poor, Women from 
disadvantaged communities, Suppliers from under-represented groups (e.g. Women owned enterprises), Employees 
with disability or from LGBTQ+ groups. Boosting and strengthening our urban primary healthcare system is a focus 
area for us. For example, enhancing education facilities for children with disabilities in marginalized communities , 
providing healthcare to migrant workers.

1.	 We have undertaken to perform reasonable assurance engagement, for WIPRO LIMITED (the “Company”) vide our 
engagement letter dated April 8, 2024 in respect of the agreed Sustainability Information listed below (the “Identified 
Sustainability Information” or “BRSR Core indicators”) in accordance with the Criteria stated in paragraph 3 below. This 
Sustainability Information is included in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (the “BRSR” or the 
“Report”) within  the Integrated Annual Report (the “IAR”) of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2024. This 
engagement was conducted by our multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, environmental engineers 
and specialists.
2.	 Identified Sustainability Information 
Our scope of reasonable assurance consists of the BRSR Core indicators listed in the Appendix I to our report. The 
reporting boundary of the Report is as disclosed in Question 13 of Section A: General Disclosure of the BRSR with 
exceptions disclosed by way of note under respective questions of the BRSR, where applicable.
Our reasonable assurance engagement was with respect to the year ended March 31, 2024 information only and we 
have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods, and any elements thereto, and, therefore, do not 
express any opinion thereon.
3.	 Criteria 
The Criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is as under:
• 
Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (the “SEBI”) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure

Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation 
and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation of the Report and the measurement of Identified 
Sustainability Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
5.	 Inherent limitations 
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial 
information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability 
between companies.
6.	 Our Independence and Quality Control

7.	 Our Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information listed in 
Appendix I based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained. 
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements (SSAE)

“Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements” (together the “Standards”), both issued by the Sustainability 
Reporting Standards Board (the “SRSB”) of the ICAI.
These Standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
Identified Sustainability Information listed in Appendix I and included in the Report are prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
As part of reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with the Standards, we exercise professional judgment 
and maintain professional skepticism throughout the engagement.
8.	 Reasonable Assurance 
A reasonable assurance engagement involves identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the 
Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the 
circumstances.
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes 
performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, 
analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we: 
• 
Obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and related disclosures;
• 
Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and/or measurements 
of the Identified Sustainability Information;
• 
Made inquiries of Company’s management, including Sustainability team, Facilities Management Group, Human 
resource team amongst others and those with the responsibility for preparation of the Report;
• 
Obtained an understanding and performed an evaluation of the design of the key systems, processes and controls 
for recording, processing and reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information at the corporate office and at 
other locations/offices on a sample basis. This included evaluating the design of those controls relevant to the 
engagement and determining whether they have been implemented by performing procedures in addition to inquiry 
of the personnel responsible for the Identified Sustainability Information;
• 
Based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may be materially 
misstated, determined the nature, timing and extent of further procedures;
• 
Tested the Company’s process for collating the  sustainability information through agreeing or reconciling the 
Identified Sustainability Information with the underlying records on a sample basis; and 
• 
Tested the consolidation for locations/offices on a sample basis under the reporting boundary for ensuring the 
completeness of data being reported.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable 
assurance opinion.
9.	 Exclusions 
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion on: 
• 
Aspects of the Report and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identified Sustainability 
Information; and
• 
The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions provided 
by the Company.
10.	Other information

reporting boundary of the Report is as disclosed in Question 13 of Section A: General Disclosure of the BRSR with

do not express any conclusion thereon.

4.	 Management’s Responsibility 
	
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the 
Sustainability Information including the reporting boundary of the Report, taking into account applicable laws and 
regulations, if any, related to reporting on the Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, engagement 
with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance

Appendix I based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained.

Sustainability at Wipro
	
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements (SSAE) 
3000, “Assurance Engagements on Sustainability Information”, (the “Standard”), issued by the Sustainability 
Reporting Standards Board (the “SRSB”) of the ICAI.
	
This Standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the 
Identified Sustainability Information is free from material misstatement.
	
As part of limited assurance engagement, in accordance with the Standard, we exercise professional judgment and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout the engagement.
8.	 Limited Assurance 
	
A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the 
Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information as listed in Appendix I, assessing 
the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, 
responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of the 
Identified Sustainability Information.
	
A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation 
to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed 
in response to the assessed risks.
	
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of 
processes performed, inspection of documents and evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and 
reporting policies and agreeing with underlying records. 
	
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we: 
• 
Obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and related disclosures;
• 
Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and/or measurements 
of the Identified Sustainability Information;
• 
Made inquiries of Company’s management, including Sustainability team, Facilities Management Group, Human 
Resource team amongst others and those with the responsibility for preparation of the Report;
• 
Obtained an understanding of the key systems and processes for recording, processing and reporting on the 
Identified Sustainability Information at locations /offices on a sample basis;
• 
Based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may be materially 
misstated, determined the nature, timing and extent of further procedures; and
• 
Reviewed the Company’s process for collating the sustainability information through agreeing or reconciling the 
Identified Sustainability Information with the underlying records on a sample basis. 
	
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent 
than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance 
engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable 
assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Identified 
Sustainability Information have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria. 
has context menu	
	
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited 
assurance conclusion.
9.	 Exclusions 
	
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express a conclusion on: 
• 
Aspects of the Report and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identified Sustainability 
Information; and 
• 
The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions 
provided by the Company.
