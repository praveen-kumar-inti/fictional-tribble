Data Security 
Risk 
As the Company and its subsidiaries continue to expand its 
delivery of products and services via the Internet, it navigates 
the inherent tension between leveraging customer data for 
innovation and addressing significant privacy concerns. The 
extensive use of personal, demographic, content, and 
behavioural data to enhance customer offerings and drive 
revenue could attract regulatory scrutiny worldwide. 
Additionally, the provision of cloud-based software and IT 
services raises issues regarding potential governmental access 
to user data, which could be used to infringe on citizens’ 
rights.
To mitigate these risks, the Company and its 
subsidiaries aim to implement robust data 
management 
strategies 
that 
prioritize 
privacy 
and 
compliance. 
Effective 
management in this area is crucial for 
maintaining trust and ensuring sustainable

Managing 
Systemic 
Risks from 
Technology 
Disruptions 
Risk 
For the Company and its subsidiaries, identifying and 
managing systemic risks from technology disruptions is 
crucial due to the industry’s heavy reliance on advanced 
technological infrastructure and digital solutions. The rapid 
evolution of technology, increasing cybersecurity threats, and 
potential system failures can lead to significant operational 
disruptions, data breaches, and financial losses. Given the 
Company’s and its subsidiaries  focus on providing innovative 
solutions in cybersecurity, digital innovation, and enterprise 
transformation, any technology disruption can cascade through 
the value chain, impacting not only the Company  and its 
subsidiaries but also its clients and stakeholders. 
To adapt to or mitigate systemic risks from 
technology disruptions the Company  and its 
subsidiaries  aim in implementing robust 
cybersecurity 
measures, 
continuous 
monitoring, and updating of technological 
infrastructure to address vulnerabilities 
proactively. Developing a comprehensive 
business continuity plan ensures rapid 
response and recovery from disruptions. 
Additionally, regular risk assessments and 
scenario planning help anticipate potential

Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving

Yes. The Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Managerial Personnel addresses the issue of 
conflict of interest, which may arise when a director’s or senior managerial personnel’s personal 
interests interfere, or even appear to interfere, with the interests of the Company and its 
subsidiaries as a whole. If a conflict of interest is likely, they are required to disclose all relevant 
facts and circumstances openly. By enforcing these guidelines, we aim to maintain transparency, 
uphold ethical standards, and ensure that the interests of the Company and its stakeholders are 
always prioritized. The said Code of Conduct can be accessed at: https://www.Aurionpro.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/02/code-of-conduct.pdf.  
 
We also have an internal Code of Conduct (Available on Intranet) which inter-alia covers elements 
of conflict of interest. It prohibits engaging in any business, relationship, or activity that conflicts 
with the Company’s interests. Employees and Directors must avoid situations where personal 
benefits could influence Company decisions or impair independent judgment. Any unavoidable 
conflicts must be fully disclosed to the Board or Compliance Officer, even if not legally required, 
and Directors must disclose their interests in Company transactions in accordance with the 
applicable legal provisions.

environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such 
consultations provided to the Board. 
 
Currently, there are no formal processes established for consultation between Stakeholders and the 
Board on ESG topics. However, it is important to note that the Company is in the early stages of its 
ESG journey. As this is the Company’s first year of publishing the BRSR, there is an 
acknowledgment of the need to establish such processes in the future. Once initiated, feedback from 
stakeholder consultations will be meticulously documented and presented to the Board for 
consideration. Moving forward, the Company and its subsidiaries are committed to developing robust 
processes for stakeholder engagement, ensuring that their perspectives and concerns are effectively 
integrated into decision-making processes related to economic, environmental, and social matters.

environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the

 Presently, the Company and its subsidiaries do not have established consultation processes between 
Stakeholders and the Board regarding the mentioned topics, as we are still in the early stages of their 
ESG journey. Recognizing the importance of this, our future plans include identifying and managing 
environmental and social topics for Board consideration. Our commitment moving forward involves 
developing comprehensive stakeholder engagement processes to incorporate our perspectives into 
decision-making on economic, environmental, and social matters. 
 
3. Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of

involvement. We are dedicated to proactively seeking opportunities to address their concerns and 
prioritize their well-being in our decision-making processes. In the future, we plan to take concrete 
actions to support these stakeholder groups, ensuring their voices are heard and their needs are

initial steps towards energy efficiency and sustainability. All our premises are equipped with LED lighting, 
and we use 5-star rated air conditioning systems to reduce energy consumption. Additionally, some of our 
employees have adopted the use of e-bikes, contributing to lower emissions. Looking ahead, we are exploring 
the feasibility of installing rooftop solar panels to further our commitment to sustainable practices and 
significantly reduce our carbon footprint.
