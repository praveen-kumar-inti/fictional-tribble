3.  Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of 
life, for
  	
(a) 	 Plastics (including packaging)
Under the Environment Protection Act 1986, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change notified 
and amended the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, providing for collection, segregation, processing, 
treatment and disposal of plastic waste in an environmentally sound manner. Rules emphasise on the Polluter’s 
Pay Principle through mandates on Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) where Brand Owners are expected 
to collect back the plastic packaging waste generated due to their products either individually or collectively 
through waste collection agencies.
Pre-consumer plastic packaging waste from each facility is channelised to the Pollution Control Board (PCB) 
approved plastic waste processors for end-of-life waste management activities such as recycling.
Extended Producer Responsibility for post-consumer plastic packaging waste is executed by registered plastic 
waste processors in designated states through tie-ups with urban local bodies, logistic partners for collecting 
and transporting plastic waste and a vast network of collection centers managed through numerous collection 
partners located across India.
A mechanical recycling method is used to process the plastic waste into recyclate without significantly changing 
the chemical structure of the material. Major unit operations for the recyclate preparation and production 
constitute identification & segregation (according to resin type, quality, structure, shape, recyclability etc.), 
washing, grinding, agglomeration, extrusion & granulation. Before being used in the production of new plastic 
products, the properties of recyclates are assessed through quality testing for the specifications of intended use.
	
 (b) 	 E-waste
E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022 rules is applicable for every manufacturer, producer, consumer, bulk 
consumer, collection centers, dealers, e-retailer, refurbisher, dismantler and recycler involved in the 
manufacture, sale, transfer, purchase, collection, storage and processing of e-waste or electrical and electronic 
equipment listed in Schedule I, including their components, consumables, parts and spares which make the 
product operational.
The responsibility of disposal of e-waste has been assigned to producers of notified Electrical & Electronic 
Equipment (EEE) under the principle of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). Under the EPR regime, producers 
of EEE, are given annual e-waste collection and recycling targets based on the generation from the previously 
sold EEE.
The entity has an obligation to report for product categories like Variable Messaging Signs (VMS), Polishers, 
Dust extraction machines and a few medical products (Antivac, sterilisation machine, etc.) as per Schedule 1 
which will be applicable from FY 23-24.

(c)	 Hazardous waste
Hazardous waste generated at the entity’s manufacturing locations are disposed as per the Hazardous and Other 
Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Amendment Rules, 2022 which is managed by the entity’s 
Environment Health & Safety Department.
Products sold by the entity are categorised as hazardous waste after their end of life based on the hazard, the 
nature and area of application. As a part of the regulatory assessment during new product introduction, every 
product before its launch is checked to see if it falls under the scope of these rules after the shelf life. Accordingly, 
the applicability is communicated to the end customer through Section 15 of 3M’s Material Safety Data Sheet 
(MSDS).
	
(d)  	 Other waste
The Battery Waste Management Rules (BWMR), notified in 2022 replaces the Battery (Management & Handling) 
rules, 2001. The rules shall apply to producer, dealer and consumer entities involved in the collection, 
segregation, transportation, re-furnishment and recycling of waste battery and all types of batteries are included 
in the rule regardless of chemistry, shape, volume, weight, material composition and use.
The entity falls under the “Producer” category and has applied for registration with the Central Pollution Control 
Board (CPCB) for compliance to the new BWM Rule. Batteries introduced in the market shall meet the collection 
and recycling targets as mentioned in Schedule II of the Extended Producer Responsibility rules.
The producer shall also provide an Extended Producer Responsibility plan to the Central Pollution Control 
Board by 30th June of every year for the batteries manufactured in the preceding financial year. It shall contain 
information on the quantity, weight of battery along with the dry weight of the battery materials through the 
centralised portal.
4.  Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No).
	
Yes.
 
If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted 
to Pollution Control Boards?
	
Yes.
	
The Extended Producer Responsibility target for Brand Owners is set at 70% of the eligible quantity of packaging waste 
by the Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2022, published by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and 
Climate Change.
	
For FY 22-23, the entity has partnered with registered plastic waste processors to collect and recycle 1004.54 metric 
tonnes of plastic packaging waste, fulfilling our Extended Producer Responsibility obligations.
	
This has been achieved in accordance with the Brand Owner registration granted by the Central Pollution Control 
Board and Action Plan on the Centralised Extended Producers Responsibility Portal for Plastic Packaging.
 
If not, provide steps taken to address the same.	
Leadership Indicators

Life cycle management (LCM) is integrated into all 3M products through the new product introduction process, covering 
the Environmental Health & Safety evaluation of raw material composition and product characteristics, assessments in 
human health and environmental toxicology, conformance to regulatory and customer EHS requirements and hazard 
communication documents.
For select products, we conduct Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs), Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), product 
carbon footprints (PCFs) and screening assessments, which help us better understand the potential impact of our 
products.
During the year under review, the entity did not conduct any Lifecycle assessment (LCA) for any of its locally

10. Health and safety management system:
 
a. 
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No)
	
	
Yes.
 
 
If yes, the coverage of such a system?
3M continually strives to maintain the highest standard of safety at all workplaces to ensure people, assets and 
our businesses are operating in the most efficient manner. All our manufacturing facilities have been certified 
with ISO 45001, a standard for management systems of Occupational Health and Safety Standards reinforcing 
the Company’s commitment to leadership in safety and health. We utilise the Compliance & Audit Management 
& Metrics System (CAMMS) portal customised to 3M requirements to track and monitor all applicable EHS 
compliance and legal obligations.
Initiatives like the ‘See & Act’ programme enable us to strengthen the safety culture at our sites, by involving 
workers on the shop floor and empowering them to take ownership of unsafe acts and problem solve for improved 
safety. The entity has a resolution rate of 76% of problems identified through the ‘See & Act’ programme.
Zero Lost Time Injury is a key metric to uphold safety performance. All manufacturing sites were able to maintain 
Zero Lost time injuries during the year due to continuous focus on preventive actions.
The Company’s EHS Cultural Excellence programme lays down the execution model and manufacturing excellence 
principles which ensure a safe and healthy workforce. This framework covers sections like ergonomics, industrial 
hygiene, process hazard management (PHM), ventilation programmes, static management plan, combustible 
dust management, safety trainings, health and wellness programmes.
Our progress against each of these parameters is assessed through regular audits.
 
b.  What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
The entity proactively identifies risks and mitigates them through programmes like High Hazard Activity (HHA), 
Safety Hour and See & Act.
Our Process Hazard Management workbook identifies process safety risks and their mitigation plans. Risk 
Assessment for Machine (RAM) identifies machine safety risks. The Ergonomic Job Risk Analyzer tool addresses 
ergonomic risks and Job Safety Analysis assesses non-routine activities.
Each of these tools are specially curated to handle various types of risks. The actions arising from these risk 
assessments are tracked electronically in our ‘EHS 360’ tool for completion with proper evidence for closure.
 
c. 
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks?  
Yes.
The entity has an EHS cultural acceleration programme which engages employees to take initiative to create safe 
environments, understand and reduce the risks, adhere to safety practices and be comfortable raising concerns.
The ‘SEE & ACT’ programme empowers employees to identify unsafe acts and conditions and understand the 
root cause of their occurrence through dialogue.
Monthly focus themes are observed to drive improvements across each of the EHS categories.
Competencies are enhanced through trainings on various EHS topics like fire safety, process safety, behavior 
based safety, use of PPEs, first aid, machine safety to name a few.
All these efforts translate into the EHS metrics being achieved. Notably, there has been ZERO Lost Time injuries 
at all three manufacturing sites.
 
d.  Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?
Yes.
All our manufacturing facilities are equipped with fully functional Occupational Health centers that are available 
24x7 for employees and workers with both basic occupational and non-occupational healthcare support.

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
We monitor our employees based on their potential exposure to chemical and physical hazards in the workplace. 
We screen for early signs of occupational illnesses to protect workers from further exposure and we provide medical 
support. We look for trends in the health data of working populations to assure that potential hazards are well 
controlled. Certain employees working on the shop floor who are exposed to certain chemical / physical hazards 
undergo tests like Pulmonary function test (PFT), vision test, Audiogram, etc.,
Hepatitis B Vaccination has been provided to all the ERT (emergency response team members) at the entity’s sites. 
Shopfloor awareness sessions are conducted on important observance days like World Hearing Day, World Heart 
Day, Women’s Day and World Diabetes Day.
Certified First Aid Training is provided for the first responders team.
Chemical Health Hazard Awareness sessions are organised to create awareness on the health impact of chemical 
exposure and control measures.
Employees’ families are also invited to manufacturing sites to showcase the entity’s health & safety systems providing 
families reassurance on the safe working conditions on site.

Although it applies to all suppliers, our supply chain risk assessment process prioritises higher-risk suppliers. The 
process begins with a self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) that helps us understand supplier programmes and 
determine if they meet our expectations. The SAQ focuses on our Supplier Responsibility Code (SRC) requirements. 
3M may conduct a virtual or on-site assessment. We address any deficiencies through a Supplier Responsibility Code 
(SRC) Corrective Action Preventive Action (CAPA) process. Follow-up on the CAPA may include additional audits. If 
a supplier is unable or unwilling to resolve any gaps or findings, the CAPA process moves to the Responsible Sourcing 
Supplier Issue Escalation process. If the supplier is still unwilling to work on the gaps or can’t resolve them in a 
reasonable amount of time, a cross-functional team considers alternative actions to elevate and resolve the situation.

Leadership Indicators
1.  Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
We consider both internal and external stakeholders on matters related to economic, environmental and social topics. 
During Board meetings, business and departmental heads present various internal and external company related topics 
with the board members who share insights on taking appropriate actions and steps.
At the Board level, the Stakeholder Committee reviews topics and concerns related to shareholders and investors. 
The CSR Committee reviews CSR programmes and investments in communities on a periodic basis.
2. 
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental and 
social topics. 
	
Yes.
 
If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
Our manufacturing sites operate close to rural communities. Our manufacturing teams have established good relations 
with local authorities to learn about local environmental and social challenges. We have developed some of our CSR 
programmes taking into consideration the needs of the local communities.
For instance, during the year under review, the entity implemented a CSR project in Shirur Taluk, rural belt of Pune, 
where our manufacturing site is located (Ranjangaon) to strengthen primary healthcare infrastructure with solar 
powered installations. Through all stages of implementation, the District and Tehsil Health Officials along with the 
medical officers of each of the primary health centers were important stakeholders providing input on the challenges 
of running these centers with frequent power outages.
During the year, we also recognised the first set of graduates emerging from the Project Nanhi Kali programme which 
is currently educating girls from underpreviliged backgrounds in Ambegaon, Pune. The felicitation programme served 
as an encouragement to the girls to continue their higher education after completing their formal education. Inputs 
from the non profit implementation partner, local school authorities and parents of the children were considered when 
developing this initiative which has enhanced the impact of the programme.
3.  Provide details of instances of engagement with and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalised stakeholder groups.
In addition to the examples provided against Q2, our partnership with the Smile Foundation supports the operations 
of 4 mobile health vans in aspirational districts and rural communities. These vans offer a comprehensive range of 
preventive, promotive and curative healthcare services to underserved populations. One of the vans operating in 
an aspirational district in Assam played a crucial role in providing vital healthcare access and relief materials to the 
affected communities during a natural disaster.

At its manufacturing site in Ranjangaon, Pune, the entity has invested in an on-site solar installation by converting 
the unused rooftop of the facility into a solar power plant. The plant currently generates annual power of 6,25,000 
kW contributing to reducing carbon emissions annually by 500 metric tonnes.
At its Bangalore manufacturing site, the entity has partnerships with local utilities to purchase solar power from the 
grid through solar wheeling.
The share of renewable energy is growing with these initiatives which is at 21.3 % of total energy consumption.
The Ranjangaon site also switched to natural gas, a cleaner and lighter fuel, from propane, to fire the equipment at 
the plant.
Other energy efficiency efforts include upgrading the chiller equipment, installing LED lighting at all sites, HVAC 
machinery optimisation and waste minimisation at source at production lines to improve yield, which have helped 
reduce energy consumption at all sites.
