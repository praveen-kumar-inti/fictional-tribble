7.1%. With optimization in processes, we could able to reach TSR of 6.6% in our Kiln at JKLC-Durg. In FY23-24 at group level 
(JKLC-Sirohi& JKLC-Durg) we were able to reach TSR level of 7%, which has helped us in reducing our Scope-1 CO2 emissions.
 
We are committed to SBTi to reduce our GHG emissions, we are also the member of RE% and have committed to meet our 
100% electrical energy consumption through renewable energy by 2040. 
8. 
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission?  If Yes, then provide details.
 
We have also commissioned 56 MWp solar project for our JKLC-Durg unit which has helped us in reducing our Scope-2 CO2 
emissions. We at JKLC-Sirohi unit has ordered 7MWp solar project which will further improve our RE% and thus will result in 
reducing our CO2 emissions.

Major Impact
 
•  
16.29-hectare area developed as green belt which balance the emission and prevent topsoil corrosion.
 
•  
Impact on Soil & Air due to sound & pollution arising from plant operation.
 
•

•  
Company is implementing various CSR activities in the plant nearby villages and providing support to other 
stakeholders in their development initiatives.
 
•  
Sound from machinery and heavy vehicles may hamper natural movement of wildlife animals.
 
•  
The dust emission from plant may hamper the life of ora and fauna.
 
Some of the major mitigation and remedial measures undertaken by the Company are as below-

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community. 
 
The CSR team visits communities on day-to-day basis and meet various stakeholders including beneciaries, panchayat 
representatives and others. The process of continuous engagement with the community is an ongoing process. The 
frequency of the engagement and interaction depends on nature of the stakeholder like project beneciaries in local 
communities do happen on daily and weekly basis whereas that of panchayats and government line departments do 
happen on fortnightly and monthly basis. These day-to-day interactions help the CSR team to gather feedbacks and 
complaints if any. The feedback is used to improve and modify CSR projects. This system is an informal one and has helped  
to resolve issues and response to the demands of stakeholders to their satisfaction. The Company also undertakes materiality 
analysis on time-to-time basis as a part of its sustainability reporting initiatives. Based on this respective departments 
undertake engagement and activities to address materiality issues. Plants have a system of monthly review of all 
departments who have external stakeholders’ interface.
