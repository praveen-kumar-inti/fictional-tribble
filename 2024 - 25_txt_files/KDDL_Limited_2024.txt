Emissions 
& Energy 
management
R
Emissions and energy management are 
critical for manufacturing companies. 
By effectively managing emissions 
and energy usage, companies can 
reduce their environmental footprint, 
comply with regulations, improve 
operational efficiency, minimise costs, 
and demonstrate a commitment to 
sustainability. Proactive management 
of emissions and energy contributes 
to a greener and more responsible 
manufacturing industry.
KDDL has implemented 
structured policies and 
procedures to regularly track 
energy use and emissions, 
focusing on identifying key 
areas requiring improvement. 
The company encourages 
the adoption of renewable 
energy sources, including solar 
and wind, to help lower and 
compensate for greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions. Emission 
tracking systems are in place 
to monitor significant emission 
contributors.
 Negative
2
Water 
Management
R
Water management is essential for 
manufacturers to ensure responsible 
use of water resources, reduce 
environmental impact, and mitigate 
operational risks. Efficient water 
management practices conserve 
water, minimise water-related costs, 
comply with regulations, protect 
ecosystems, and enhance sustainability, 
demonstrating corporate responsibility 
and long-term viability.
 KDDL is committed to 
effective water conservation 
by minimising freshwater 
usage. The company has 
installed effluent treatment 
plants (ETPs) to treat 
wastewater, which is then 
reused for gardening, industrial 
processes, and production 
activities. Regular assessments 
and monitoring of water 
consumption are conducted 
to pinpoint high-usage 
areas and explore reduction 
strategies. Presently, Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) systems 
are operational at three KDDL 
facilities.
Negative
3
Waste 
Management
R
Effective waste management is crucial 
for a manufacturing company as it 
minimises environmental impact, 
ensures regulatory compliance, 
reduces operational costs, and 
enhances sustainability. Proper waste 
management practices promote 
resource efficiency, mitigate potential 
health and environmental risks, and 
demonstrate corporate responsibility.
KDDL ensures that robust 
policies and procedures guide 
the proper handling, storage, 
and disposal of waste. Waste is 
managed responsibly through 
safe storage and disposal by 
authorised third-party vendors. 
The company also promotes 
waste reduction and reuse 
methods to decrease reliance 
on virgin raw materials.

Customers play a vital role in 
KDDL’s sustainable success.

standards of product quality, 
focuses on innovation, ensures 
timely deliveries, and offers 
competitive pricing to fulfill

Health and 
Safety
R
Occupational health and safety 
are critical for a manufacturing 
company as they protect employees 
from workplace hazards, reduce 
the risk of accidents and injuries, 
improve productivity, and ensure 
legal compliance. Prioritising health 
and safety foster a positive work 
environment and safeguards the 
company’s reputation. 
KDDL has well-defined 
policies and procedures to 
assess risks and hazards 
across its operations, with 
strong measures to mitigate 
them. Routine safety audits 
and health monitoring are 
conducted to close any gaps in 
workplace safety. Employees

10. 	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your Company 
to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such 
wastes.
At our organisation, we follow comprehensive waste management protocols in full compliance with relevant laws and regulatory 
frameworks. This includes systematic segregation, secure handling, safe storage, and the environmentally responsible disposal of 
waste through authorised vendors. Our practices align with industry standards and aim to ensure efficient waste management while 
upholding our commitment to environmental sustainability.
Key Waste Management Initiatives:
•	
Formulation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for managing hazardous waste
•	
Establishment of dedicated storage facilities for both hazardous and non-hazardous waste
•	
Implementation of reuse, recycling, reprocessing, recovery, treatment, and disposal methods in accordance with state pollution control 
board regulations
•	
Disposal of hazardous waste through pollution control board-approved recyclers
•	
Operation of efficient treatment plants to ensure wastewater is treated before being discharged to centralised effluent treatment 
plants (CETPs)
This structured approach reflects our dedication to minimising environmental impact and maintaining responsible waste-handling 
practices.
