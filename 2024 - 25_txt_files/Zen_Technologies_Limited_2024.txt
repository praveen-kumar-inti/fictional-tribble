As a defence simulators manufacturer, we prioritize sustainability in our products. We use 
natural gas compressors instead of CO₂ for weapon recoil, reducing emissions. Visuals are 
projected onto walls rather than synthetic materials, cutting down plastic use. HVAC systems 
in container shooting ranges capture smoke for cleaner air, and lead from fired bullets is 
recovered and reused, promoting resource efficiency and environmental safety.

with new ones, facilitating safe and sustainable battery waste management.
