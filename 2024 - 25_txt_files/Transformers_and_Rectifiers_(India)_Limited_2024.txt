Governance, leadership and oversight
7.  Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has ﬂexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
We are delighted to share the incredible progress we have made in our sustainability journey at Transformers and Rectiﬁers India 
Limited. Our commitment to environmental stewardship and workplace safety is driving us towards a future where we thrive in 
harmony with the world around us. This has helped us achieve the tag of Great Place to Work. 
One signiﬁcant step we have taken towards sustainability is the installation of a 1MW solar rooftop system at our Moraiya and 
Changodhar plants. This move not only reduces our carbon footprint but also sets a great example for embracing renewable 
energy sources.
Moreover, our efforts to manage water resources responsibly are evident through the installation of recharge wells at our plants 
and the reuse of wastewater for gardening within our premises after treatment in our Sewage Treatment Plants (STP). Additionally, 
our waste management practices, which involve sending waste to authorized recyclers, underscore our commitment to a circular 
economy.
Safety is at the core of all our operations, and our robust Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) system ensures that our employees 
and workers have a safe working environment. Our annual Safety Week initiatives, focusing on raising awareness and cultivating a 
safety-ﬁrst culture through quizzes, poster competitions, and dedicated training sessions, are instrumental in nurturing a safe 
workplace.
Furthermore, our dedication to skill development is evident through initiatives such as the Uday and Aarambh programs, aimed at 
upskilling our existing workforce and building a skilled team through collaborations with Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs).
As we look ahead, we strive to push the boundaries of sustainability, making conscious efforts to enhance our environmental 
responsibility, workplace safety, and skills development programs.
