Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes. 
At AIS across all the manufacturing plants, we continuously monitor waste generation on a day-to-day basis, and measures are 
taken into consideration to effectively store, manage, and safely dispose of the waste as per pollution control board guidelines. 
Being a glass manufacturer, cullet is our major waste form, however, we are working very precisely and following all the safety 
norms, to reduce the unwanted generation of broken glasses and on a time-to-time basis, we train our workers on safety norms. 
Additionally, for glass printing, sealant and ink materials are used, which are categorised hazardous waste, therefore, the empty 
bottles are collected and stored at a separate location and safely disposed of through authorized vendors, as per state pollution 
control board (SPCB) guidelines.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details 
in 100 words/ web-link. 
At AIS, all locations have ‘A Business Contingency and Emergency Response plan’, which enables the company to adapt to any 
situation arising from any natural calamity or an unprecedented event that may disrupt the business operations at the plant level 
and the central level. Additionally, a crisis management plan to manage the major business risk is there which encompasses four 
basic activities: Mitigation, Preparedness, Response and Recovery in the identified emergency situations. Further, the Company's 
risk management plan enables the minimization of disaster-linked losses, by assessing the potential for major disruption and its 
consequent risks to the business, and providing the appropriate mitigation plans. 
8. 
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or 
adaptation measures have been taken by the entityin this regard. 
AIS ensures to minimize its environmental footprint during business operations and across its value chain activities. As a result of 
this, the company has adopted ROHS compliance as a critical part of its procurement policy and practice to minimize hazardous 
waste and ensure effective chemical use and management. In addition to this, 
to mitigate GHG emissions during transportation, 
energy consumption based upon green fuel is being planned by NCR Delhi based suppliers in Delhi as per the Government of 
India’s notification and our customer’s needs and aspirations 
for green fuel and lower emission levels. To avoid adverse impacts 
on the environment, the company has reduced the wooden packaging used for dispatch of finished product (Glass), now more 
than 80% of glass dispatch is in loose form (without packaging) and it replaces batch size with cullet (glass scrap) and recycles this 
in furnaces, to reduce mineral consumption.
