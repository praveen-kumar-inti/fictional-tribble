Leadership Indicators

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
Stakeholder consultations are a structured part of the Company’s governance and sustainability processes. These engagements 
are typically led by relevant Functional Heads and senior executives, depending on the nature of the issue or stakeholder 
group involved. When concerns are raised during these interactions, they are assessed and where necessary, escalated to the 
Managing Director or routed to the appropriate Board-level Committees. These Committees are responsible for key areas such 
as Risk Management, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Sustainability, Strategic Partnerships and budgeting - ensuring that 
stakeholder inputs are addressed through informed and accountable decision-making.
	
In addition to ongoing interactions, the Company conducts formal materiality assessments at regular intervals. These 
assessments involve stakeholder surveys, one-on-one interviews and focused group discussions designed to gather diverse 
perspectives. This process helps the Company identify the most relevant environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics 
from a stakeholder perspective and align its business strategy, sustainability priorities and reporting accordingly.

topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics

the materiality assessment process-via stakeholder surveys, consultations and meetings-are integrated into the Company’s 
sustainability strategy and operations.

a.	
Do you have a preferential procurement policy where you give preference to purchase from suppliers comprising

The Company does not operate with a policy that favors specific suppliers. Because the raw materials used in its 
manufacturing processes are typically not produced by small-scale or local vendors, Veedol sources them from established 
suppliers at both national and international levels. In contrast, packaging materials are occasionally procured from nearby 
vendors, including Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), when suitable. Supplier choices are based purely 
on practical factors such as product quality, pricing and reliability of delivery. When possible, the Company also engages 
with these suppliers through informative sessions and supplier interactions, offering updates on industry developments, 
regulatory changes and good practices to support mutual growth.
