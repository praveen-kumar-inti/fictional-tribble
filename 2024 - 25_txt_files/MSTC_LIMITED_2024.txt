We have signiﬁcantly enhanced our human rights training programmes, covering 40.32% of our

further. 
This year, we strengthened our performance and career development reviews, achieving 100% coverage for 
all employees—both male and female. Employee safety remains a top priority, and we are proud to 
maintain our zero-incident record, reinforcing our commitment to "Zero Harm".
We continue to strengthen our ESG governance framework, with notable improvements in data availability 
and quality compared to the previous year. To ensure strict legal compliance, we rigorously ensure full 
adherence to regulatory requirements.
Governance, Leadership and Oversight
7. Statement by Director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has ﬂexibility regarding the placement of this 
disclosure)
At MSTC, we continue to uphold our unwavering commitment to promote good corporate governance, 
conduct business with the highest levels of transparency, and adhere to stringent ethical standards. Our 
Integrity Pact, mandatory in all contracts, epitomises this dedication, reﬂecting our commitment to ethical 
practices as suggested by Transparency International India to the Ministry of Steel.
ESG-Related Achievements
The Indian economy concluded the past ﬁscal on a robust note, driven by strong business and consumer 
sentiments, sustained public investment, easing inﬂation, and a favourable external environment. However, 
extended geopolitical tensions and persistent high real interest rates pose risks to the growth trajectory.
This year, we invested approximately `46.87 lakhs in CSR initiatives within an aspirational district, funding the 
purchase and installation of medical equipment for a charitable blood bank.
Challenges and Threats
GeM Portal Impact: The government's directive to use the GeM Portal for purchases poses a challenge to our 
e-procurement business, as it reduces our exposure and scope of work in this area.
Business Model Adaptation: The rapidly changing technological landscape requires continuous adaptation 
to meet new customer demands and preferences, presenting both a challenge and an opportunity for 
growth.
Future Outlook
Cybersecurity Risks: We continue to face the threat of cyber-attacks, which could impact business 
operations, reputation, and ﬁnancial stability. Ensuring robust cybersecurity measures remains a top 
priority.
Substantial progress has been made in ensuring fair and equitable pay, with median remuneration 
increases across all levels for both genders.
Our focus remains on delivering integrated, paperless, and seamless services to government and non-
government organisations, thereby strengthening our nation’s progress.
