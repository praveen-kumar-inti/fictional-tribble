Opportunity Being responsible on environmental 
sustainability, IRB has identified 
and leveraged the potential of 
green procurement as a value 
creation source to ensure a labour & 
environment friendly atmosphere at 
critical supplier’s locations. IRB has 
started to focus on Third-Party value

anticorruption declarations, fair wages 
to be paid, Human Rights parameters, 
prohibiting child/forced labour etc.

Environmental 
Sustainability
Risk & 
Opportunity
Rigorous scientific research 
confirms that emissions stemming 
from industrial activities amplify 
the greenhouse effect, thereby 
underscoring the critical need for 
companies to implement robust 
sustainable management strategies.
We are committed to minimising waste 
generation, conserving energy and 
natural resources, efficient water usage 
and reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
throughout our operations. We have

Employee 
Development 
and 
Engagement
Opportunity Employee engagement thrives on 
mutual trust, integrity, commitment, 
and communication. Ongoing skill 
enhancement and training initiatives 
have cultivated a proficient and 
experienced workforce prepared to 
tackle demanding tasks, fostering 
their development for elevated roles 
and responsibilities.
Positive
4
Diversity & 
Inclusion
Opportunity Diversity and Inclusion is a key 
facet of equal opportunity employer 
and with the emerging focus on 
unique skill sets from a diverse 
workforce. Diversity and Inclusion 
improve company performance by 
bringing together people with varied 
knowledge, views, and perspectives. 
This results in identifying innovative 
ideas and improves talent attraction 
and retention at the workplace. As an 
organisation, we believe that a diverse 
workforce can broaden workplace 
knowledge and experience, enhance 
output and help generate innovative 
ideas and thoughts.
Our construction project employees 
come from all across the country. 
Despite carrying regional diversity, 
we continue to forge common 
moral values, work ethics and 
understanding through our well-
designed management policies.
Positive

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk & 
Opportunity
The Company strongly advocates

safe and healthy workplace for all its 
employees and project sites.
We are also committed to provide 
adequate resources to ensure all 
EHS compliances & maintain a zero-
tolerance policy when it comes to 
health & safety.
The nature of business involves 
critical activities and presence of 
heavy machinery, moving vehicles, 
and other construction tools that 
exposes employees and workers to 
potential hazards.
Implementation of robust health & safety 
measures, provision of adequate training, 
and adherence to safety protocols are 
ensured to safeguard the well-being 
of workers and to prevent potential 
catastrophic consequences associated 
with the construction and maintenance 
activities.
Certification to ISO 45001 (Occupational

is vital for social license to operate 
for our operations. It is crucial that

Technology 
and Innovation
Risk & 
Opportunity
In an ever-evolving world, adaptability 
and innovation are not just desirable 
traits but essential components for 
the success and relevance of any 
industry. This holds particularly true for 
the realm of highways construction, 
where the landscape is constantly 
shaped by emerging technologies 
and innovative practices. The rapid 
pace of technological advancement 
offers unprecedented opportunities 
to revolutionise how we plan, design, 
construct, and maintain highways. 
From cutting-edge materials to state-
of-the-art construction techniques, the 
industry is witnessing a paradigm shift 
towards more efficient, sustainable, 
and resilient infrastructure solutions. 
We recognise the pivotal role that 
technology and innovation play in 
shaping the future of our industry.
Adaptation to new technologies would 
offer some challenges in the beginning 
but will be gradually addressed through 
continuous learning and development 
sessions.
Negative & 
Positive
9
Circular 
Economy
Opportunity For infrastructure developers, the 
transition to a circular economy 
represents a paradigm shift in project 
planning, design, construction, 
and operation. It entails rethinking 
traditional practices and embracing 
innovative approaches that prioritise 
resource conservation, longevity, and 
resilience. Embracing the principles 
of a circular economy is essential for 
fostering environmental stewardship, 
promoting sustainable development, 
and meeting the diverse needs of 
stakeholders. Effective material 
planning and adhering to waste 
management guidelines enable the 
Company to cause minimum negative 
impact on the environment and 
business. The Company has adopted 
3 R principle (Reduce, Recycle 
and Reuse) in context to effective 
management of materials and waste.

10. 	 Health and safety management system:
	
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ 
No). If yes, the coverage of such a system?
	
	
Yes, the organisation has established and oversees an OHS management system aimed at enhancing health and 
safety performance. Consistent with the IRB’s vision and HSW policy, management systems are implemented in 
alignment with the International Standards ISO 45001:2018, outlining mandatory requirements for systematic 
management and execution within the organisation. This comprehensive system entails the development of 
policies, procedures, and practices to identify and mitigate workplace hazards, promote employee well-being, and 
ensure compliance with pertinent regulations across all work locations, including construction projects, operation 
and maintenance sites, toll plazas, and offices. Accredited by international certification body (ISOQAR), the IMS 
system incorporates ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015, and ISO 45001:2018 standards.
	
b. 	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
	
	
The company has in place a systematic hazard identification and risk management process to identify and control 
all the hazards existing in routine and non-routine activities across all the sites. We follow a five-step approach 
(identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring, and reporting), which also acts as a key driver for controlling the 
risk of EHS in business. Prior to commencing any work activity, Hazard Identification and Risk Assessments, SOPs, 
Work Methodologies, etc. are developed and pre-approved by all the relevant stakeholders, including management 
staff and workers. We adhere to a hierarchical approach for mitigating risks, with a strong emphasis on engineering 
control measures. All identified risks and risk mitigation plans are documented, approved, and communicated to all 
relevant authorities and parties as and when required.
	
	
Our operational safety is overseen by a safety committee, which is chaired by the project head, business head and 
representatives of different business functions. This committee ensures equal representation from management 
and workers. During the monthly safety committee meeting, updates and briefings related to safety aspects are 
discussed, and specific concerns are addressed. The safety committee reviews future action plans related to the 
project or work location, ensures a comprehensive risk assessment is conducted, and communicates adequate 
corrective measures until they are implemented.
	
c. 	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes, we have implemented thorough Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and standardised reporting formats 
to document hazards and incidents, including detailed root cause analysis. We strongly encourage our employees 
and workers to report all hazards, near-misses, and incidents. Supervisors are available to provide guidance and 
support for corrective actions as needed. Additionally, we ensure that all employees and workers are well-informed 
and fully aware of our environmental, health, and safety (EHS) management system.

12. 	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
The company’s HSW policy embeds safety as a core value, promoting ownership at all levels and encouraging behavioural 
change to cultivate a unified safety culture. The company maintains a safe and healthy work environment by implementing 
safe operating procedures and practices, providing a hierarchy of safety controls, including necessary personal 
protective equipment (PPE), and committing adequate resources to ensure EHS compliance. These protocols ensure 
that EHS standards at all project locations exceed applicable laws, regulations, and standards and are benchmarked 
against international best practices across its diverse sectors of operation. Management demonstrates visible leadership 
and commitment to EHS through personal examples and actions, actively engaging in EHS meetings, site inspections, 
and audits to foster a positive EHS culture within IRB projects, Toll Plazas, and operations and maintenance. Roles, 
responsibilities, targets, objectives, goals, training needs, and desired behaviours are clearly outlined, agreed upon, and 
communicated across the entire organisation.
	
Within the EHS management system, a project-specific EHS plan is precisely crafted at the commencement of each new 
project, outlining the overarching parameters of EHS management. This plan carefully identifies hazardous operations 
and associated risks within the project’s scope while also detailing integrated preventive measures (controls) to mitigate 
the risks. Moreover, a systematic risk management process is implemented across all business verticals to identify and 
mitigate hazards, necessitating verification of conformity Furthermore, the company maintains a zero-tolerance policy 
regarding health and safety. Various workplace initiatives includes Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) inspections, 
Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), incident reporting and investigation, EHS training (both external and 
internal), and active participation, consultation, and communication of employees in EHS initiatives.

if our key stakeholders deem it important. In addition, we use stakeholder insights to gauge the relative importance of 
each issue.

PRINCIPLE 5: Businesses should respect and promote human rights
The core objective of this Principle is to assist organisations in demonstrating their commitment to integrating human rights 
values and principles into key processes and decisions.
The Company has established procedures to effectively engage with relevant stakeholders on human rights, ensuring a safe, 
healthy and productive workplace in consultation with employees. IRB places significant emphasis on human rights through 
its Human Rights policy, which outlines a clear strategy to uphold all employees’ rights.
The policy reinforces a commitment to comply with applicable laws and uphold the United Nations Global Compact’s principles 
on human rights and labour. Key features include safeguarding employee rights, fostering an inclusive workplace that values 
diversity, and prohibiting child labour and forced labour. The policy also addresses working conditions, compensation and 
benefits, workplace health and safety, freedom of association, and the right to collective bargaining.
