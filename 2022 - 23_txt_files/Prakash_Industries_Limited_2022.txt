Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1
Environment 
Energy and 
Emission 
Management 
Risk
As our Business is in Steel 
and Power and we use Fuel 
and Energy for its operations, 
hence we need to make  
investments for Energy 
Efficiency and Emission 
Management to meet the 
Statutory Compliances.
We strive to make timely 
and suitable investments 
for continued compliances 
and even beyond. Our 
manufacturing processes 
are energy efficient; 
help conserve natural 
resources. We have 
facilitated various emission 
reduction and energy 
conservation initiatives at our 
manufacturing facilities over 
years.
Negative:
The investments in energy 
and emission management 
systems and technologies 
have a financial impact on 
our business, which we 
consciously acknowledge 
and accept.
2
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Employees and workers are 
key resources of our business 
operations, and we believe 
in providing them a safe and 
healthy work environment. 
Additionally, Employee Health 
and Safety incidents create 
the regulatory compliance, 
reputational, and business 
continuity risks. Risk of failure/ 
non-compliance can impact 
our business operations
We strive to make suitable 
investments in safety related 
technology and Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) 
for employees. Our safety 
training programme is also an 
important aspect to mitigate 
the risk.
Positive:
However we invest in safety 
related technology, PPE 
and training, 
But it leads to  benefits of 
uninterrupted operations 
and downtime and avoid the 
losses.
3
Risk, 
Opportunities 
and Crisis 
Management
Risk
We perceive crises 
management as a risk 
because it has the potential 
of unprecedented problems  
which could lead to business 
disruptions and downtime.
We have established robust 
SOPs as per ISO systems , 
conducted toolbox meetings 
at shop floor, analysed 
near miss cases and have 
developed plans to manage 
various risk and take 
appropriate actions.
Positive: 
However  establishing 
robust HSE, and training 
of workforce/ employees 
require investments, but 
it results in a positive 
impact due to prevention 
of avoidable operational 
interruptions.
4
Employee 
Well Being
Risk
Employee Morale and 
Engagement and healthy 
work environment is the most 
important factor for employee 
wellbeing.
We focus to mitigate this 
risk by having a continuous 
interaction and focus on 
upgrading systems and 
processes to cater to 
the changing needs of 
employees and their families. 
We arrange various training 
and recreational programmes 
within the organisation 
which enhances employee 
belonging.
Positive: 
However the systems 
and processes require 
investments and costs 
in implementing and 
maintaining these 
programs, the direct result 
can be linked with increased 
employee loyalty and longer 
average service tenure and 
manpower Productivity

In the process of sponge iron production, coal is used for generating heat and chemical reaction for reducing 
the oxygen from iron ore, During this metallurgical process reaction, along with sponge iron, coal char and 
flue gas is generated as by product of DRI Process. In order to utilise Waste, this coal char is being used as 
a fuel for the generation of power in captive power plant. By utilizing the char in power Generation Company 
is saving proportionate quantity of coal and contributing for conservation of natural resources and keeping 
the nature and atmosphere clean. To utilize the flue gas of the DRI Process the company has installed the 
Waste Heat Recovery System for Generation of Power by utilizing the Flue gas.
	
The Waste generation of Power Plant is Fly ash is being used in brick /block making, road making, and various 
concrete applications and is disposed off in abandoned mines. We are having fly ash brick manufacturing 
plant inside our premises. Fly ash bricks are used in all type of construction carried out in the plant. Apart 
from this we are also disposing off fly ash in mines and low lying areas. All safe and scientific methods are 
being adopted during handling, transportation and dumping of fly ash. 
	
The Slag generated during the process of steel making in Induction Furnace contains Iron particles mixed 
with slag. To recover the iron particles, magnetic slag crusher has been established. The recovery of Iron 
particles is approximately 10% which is reused in the process of induction furnace for steel making. By this, 
proportionate amount of raw material i.e., mineral is saved. By doing such practices, we are using a waste 
as a source of energy & controlling environmental pollution and conserving the natural resources. As far as 
remaining part of slag is concerned, we are using it for levelling work and road making etc.

1
Installation of Density Separator 
System DNS for Coal Beneficiation
With the use of DNS System the 
Coal FC is improved
The Improved FC of coal resulted 
into better process of DRI Kilns 
2
Installation of Cone Crusher for 
Iron Ore Crushing 
This is resulted into provide the 
required size of Iron ore in the 
Kilns 
Leads to better operation of Kilns 
3.
Installation of Fogging system in

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web 
link. 
 
Onsite and Offsite Disaster Management Plan has been initiated. In order to monitor the effectiveness of the 
Plans, mock drills at regular intervals are carried out. The fire fighting systems are checked at regular intervals. 
Fire extinguishers have been refilled and certified. The surrounding community has been made aware through 
awareness camps about the probable disasters and the emergency response plans. Awareness programs 
have been initiated to make the employees aware of their role and responsibility during any accident.
8. 
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What 
mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard. 
 
We have provided Bag filter system for control of source emission and Fogging system for fugitive emission 
which are working more efficiently. We have deployed a road cleaning machine for better house keeping of 
the plant. We have CC roads in the plant  to minimize dust emission during vehicular movements. Time to 
time, we have made retrofitting work of ESPs, Bag filters, Venture scrubber systems & Fume scrubber systems 
to improve efficiency of air pollution control devices and to minimize the pollution load in the environment. 
We have regular programmes for plantation and this year we have planned to plant 10000 saplings in the 
plant premises. We are implementing effluent treatment plant and reuse of treated wastewater for cooling 
tower make up water, dust separation systems,  pug mills area, ash handling systems, water spraying in raw 
material storage yard & finished product area, cleaning of road area, horticulture & plantation purpose. This 
has been saving the consumption of fresh water. We have installed sewage treatment plant for treatment of 
domestic water and are using treated water for plantation purpose. 
 
The Company is installed the following systems for utilization of waste and reducing the adverse impact on 
the environment. 
	
(i)	
WASTE HEAT RECOVERY BOILER (WHRB):
	
	
WHRB is a well known technology for the generation of power from the waste heat, generated from 
source. Here, we use waste heat from rotary kiln where coal is used for the generation of heat for the 
purpose of melting of raw materials used for sponge production. Instead of leaving the huge quantity 
of heat in atmosphere which could unbalance its stability; we use it for 75 MW power generation. The 
generated power from the process is used for Industrial use. By this process, we are preventing to 
release the hot gases in atmosphere and on the other hand we are re-cycling & re-using our waste 
resources.
 
(ii) 
UTILIZATION OF COAL CHAR:
	
	
In the process of sponge iron production, coal is used as a raw material for generating heat. At the 
end of the process, coal char is also generated. This coal char is solid waste after the process which 
we are using as fuel for the generation of power in captive power plant. 
 
 
Utilizing the char in power generation, we are saving our surroundings with clean nature & atmosphere.

(iii) SLAG CRUSHER:
	
	
Slag is generated during the process of steel making in Induction Furnace which contain Iron particles 
mixed with slag. To recover the iron particles, magnetic slag crusher has been established. The recovery 
of Iron particles is approximately 10% which is reused in the process of Induction furnace for steel 
making. By this, substantial amount of raw material (i.e., mineral) is saved. By doing this, we are using 
waste as a source of mineral & controlling environmental pollution.
