regulatory interventions, reduced 
sales, reputational risks, escalated 
litigation, and subsequently, 
increased litigation expenses.
The Company being in the healthcare 
sector, the nature of its business requires 
the utmost attention to the quality of

As part of our continuous drive to improve environmental performance and reduce natural resource consumption, some of our 
manufacturing sites are equipped with effluent treatment plants to process the wastewater generated during production processes. 
This treated water is then repurposed for internal ancillary operations, including site gardening and cooling tower usage, after 
undergoing treatment at the effluent treatment site.
	
Approximately 65% of the wastewater generated in our plants is reclaimed, recycled, and repurposed, leading to a reduction in the 
demand for fresh water. Additionally, the recovery and reuse of steam condensate have contributed to a decrease in fresh water 
consumption. We are further exploring avenues to enhance the capabilities of our effluent treatment plant, with the aim of utilizing 
treated water for internal operations.
