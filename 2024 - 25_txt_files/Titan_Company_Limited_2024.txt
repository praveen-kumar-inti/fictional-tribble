Carbon, 
Emissions & 
Energy
Risk
Climate change impact 
is growing day by day. 
Especially given the increasing 
regulations in this area a lack 
of prioritisation can negatively 
impact various ESG factors.
1) Conducting carbon, emissions 
and energy audits and 
identifying areas of energy 
reduction
2) Increased sourcing of 
renewable energy.
Negative – Risk
2
Waste 
Management 
and Circular 
Economy
Risk
Poor waste management 
practices can lead to landfill 
buildup and public health 
issues. Failure to appropriately 
manage waste or to 
implement circular strategies, 
during a period of increasing 
regulation of the same, 
can negatively impact the 
Company’s reputation.
Ensuring different types of waste 
are segregated, handled and 
disposed of appropriately and 
by only authorised contractors 
of the State Pollution Control 
Board. Additionally, to develop 
and follow circular economy 
initiatives to reduce and reuse 
the waste created during 
production.
Negative – Risk
3
Water
Management
Risk
Water is becoming 
increasingly a scarce resource 
especially in India where the 
seasonal rainfalls are the 
primary source of water. Poor 
water management will lead 
to stress for the operations 
and employee well-being.
Adhering to the existing water 
management regulations and 
establishing goals for reducing 
water. Furthermore, continuously 
discovering and implementing 
better ways to measure and 
reduce water usage through 
various technologies and 
behaviour change within the 
workforce.
Negative – Risk
4
Corporate 
Governance 
(Compliance 
& Ethics)
Opportunity
Strong corporate governance 
can foster a culture of ethics 
and social responsibility, 
potentially improving 
employee well-being and 
working conditions.
These practices would further 
promote transparency, 
accountability and risk 
management within the 
Company and hence amplify 
the Brand reputation.
Mitigating risk in corporate 
governance involves establishing 
internal controls, utilising 
risk transfer mechanisms like 
engaging in active governance 
oversight through Board 
involvement. Additionally, 
ensuring the timely and accurate 
completion and submission 
of all relevant compliance 
frameworks is essential to avoid 
regulatory penalties and potential 
reputational. damageTop of Form

credibility among investors

and social topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on 
these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes. The Company has a structured methodology for stakeholder consultation. It is done by involving multiple approaches 
such as:
	
1.	
Internally each department reviews the environment aspect and impact of the activities carried out. Significant 
negative impact is identified and actions are taken.
	
2.	
The management identifies significant environment issues and addresses them through Sustainability Mission 
programs.
	
3.	
The Company has a framework to capture the interested party concern. The public or any interested parties can 
record their concern through the complaint register provided at the main entrance office. Any such complaints 
received will be reviewed by the plant environment head in charge and action taken to address the concern.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/
marginalised stakeholder groups.

The Company has a well-defined engagement with vulnerable or marginalised stakeholder groups. The women 
self-help groups (MEADOWS) that has been in existence for over three decades and that support the Company’s 
operations is a classic example of working with underprivileged women. The Karigar Centre/Park for Jewellery and 
Weavershala for the saree vendors are also examples of well-established approaches to support the vulnerable and 
under supported/served sectors. There are regular and structured interactions by the management to understand 
their needs and expectations and address concerns if any.

The Company has embedded inclusion as an important part of its CSR policy. All the programs are directed towards 
marginalised community be it people from Affirmative Action (AA), underprivileged girl child for education or the 
underprivileged youth and endangered arts and crafts communities where skilling is imparted. Apart from this, the 
Company has also embedded Persons with Disabilities (PwD) as part of the CSR/AA engagements across the country. 
These are well-defined programs and can be classified as one of best-in-class policy of inclusion. The Corporate 
Sustainability (CS) function has created a well-defined monitoring a process, which includes having reviews with the 
partners and community visits to ensure the needs and grievances if any are addressed appropriately.
