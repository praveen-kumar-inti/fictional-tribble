Negative 
: Lack of robust initiatives

adversely impact ESG profile of the 
company. 
It could

Health and 
Safety 
Risk 
Risk 
- The risks involves hazards 
caused in the working environment 
in the form of non-compliance with 
safety measures by employees, non- 
awareness 
of 
a 
safe and 
secure 
environment and con-compliance of 
COVID-19 safety measures leading 
to 
injuries, 
accidents, 
illness 
and 
fatalities. 
These 
risks 
lead 
to 
interruptions 
in 
workplace 
operations and higher attrition rate. 
Bannari Amman Sugars is OHSAS- 
18001:2007 certified. The company 
has 
efficient 
health 
and 
safety 
management systems in place. 
Negative 
- Weak mechanisms 
to 
promote 
health and 
safety 
in 
the 
workplace 
lead 
to 
higher 
absenteeism, 
employee 
turnover 
rates 
impacting 
the 
overall 
productivity. The reputation 
of the 
company is hampered and leads to 
loss 
of 
confidence 
amongst 
stakeholders. 
It could also lead 
to 
losses due to legal actions and claims 
affecting 
the 
top-line 
of 
the 
organization. 
  
Product 
Quality & 
Safety 
Risk 
Opportunity 
Risk- The company can be exposed 
to product risk losses associated with 
non-compliance of product quality 
with the requirements or standards. It 
directly 
impacts 
customer 
satisfaction and the risk of continued 
partnership 
thereby 
affecting 
the 
top-line growth of the company. 
Opportunities- Product quality and 
safety determines the success of the 
company and 
its reputation 
in the 
customer markets. 
It earns customer 
loyalty, 
helps 
to 
establish 
brand 
recognition and manages the costs. 
High 
product 
quality 
produces 
higher return on investments, higher 
productivity directly proportional to 
higher consumer demand. 
The Company has 
ISO 9001 
: 2015, ISO 9002, 
ISO/TS-22002-1:2009 and 
HALAL certifications in place. 
Positive 
- Higher product quality 
ensures higher customer satisfaction 
and stronger customer relationship. 
The company should maintain direct 
relationships with all the customers 
and continuous monitoring of the 
developments in customer's market 
Negative 
- 
Poor product quality 
and safety can have several con- 
sequences such as loss of customers, 
lower 
productivity 
and 
increased 
costs. Increased product recalls leads 
to liable for legal actions and affects 
the goodwill of the company thereby 
impacting 
the 
organization's 
revenue generation. 
  
 
 
Employee 
Engagement & 
Development 
 
Risk 
Opportunity 
 
Risk 
- 
Employee 
development 
programs 
and 
provision 
for 
employee 
benefits 
could 
be 
considered as incurred expenses to 
the company. 
Opportunities 
- 
Structured 
employee 
development 
and 
engagement 
programs 
accelerate 
the work satisfaction of the company 
thereby enhancing the performance 
and 
company’s 
topline. 
An 
enhanced collaboration amongst the 
team 
members 
lead 
to 
better 
communication, trust, talent pipeline, 
share understanding of company’s 
goals and priorities and improved 
employee retention. An empowered 
and organized workforce 
is more 
stable, predictable and productive 
which reduces resource shocks and 
generates productivity gains. 
 
Bannari Amman Sugars is QMS, 
EMS AND FSSC certified. 
 
Positive 
- A strong workforce with 
higher engagement, 
retention 
rate 
and diversity in the workforce brings 
new perspectives, experiences, and 
ideas 
which 
enable 
innovation, 
enhances 
the 
performance 
and 
enables 
a 
positive 
culture 
in 
the 
organization, 
and 
highlights 
the 
Company’s efforts toward creating a 
conducive 
work environment. 
Negative 
- The inability 
to meet 
workforce expectations may result in 
adverse 
impacts 
on 
workforce 
productivity, 
morale 
and 
the 
company’s growth plan 
in 
a long 
run.
