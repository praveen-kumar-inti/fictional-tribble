BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 
Dear Shareholders,
We are proud to present our third Business Responsibility and Sustainable Reporting (‘BRSR Report’), aligned with Securities 
and Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’) guidelines and the core principles of National Guidelines on Responsible Business 
Conduct (‘NGRBC’). Our vision of becoming leader in the Express Logistic industry, guided by a commitment to environmental 
stewardship, discrimination free environment, employee and societal well-being. The rapid growth of the logistics sector has led to 
increased carbon emissions from consignment transportation, prompting us to take proactive measures to address these climate 
challenges. Initiatives such as establishing green sorting centers, transitioning to renewable energy sources, investing in eco-friendly 
transportation systems such as e vehicles, alternative/clean fuel and enhancing low-carbon logistics solutions reflect our dedication 
towards sustainability. We continuously explore innovative approaches to reduce carbon footprints, encourage our value chain 
partners for this, and adopt advanced technologies to improve operational efficiency. Our Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(‘ESG’) practices, showcased in this report, highlight our commitment to reducing emissions, minimizing waste, conserving water, 
optimizing resource usage, and driving innovation for a greener and more sustainable future.
Our dedication to social responsibility is evident in fostering an inclusive workplace, prioritizing employee well-being, and building 
strong connections with the communities we serve. Through Corporate Social Responsibility (‘CSR’) programs like Kavach, 
Shorya, Shiksha, Saksham, and Samanta, we actively support the development of vulnerable groups within society. We also involve 
employees in shaping our ESG strategies, regularly monitoring key performance indicators (‘KPI’s) to drive improvement and submit 
performance results for continuous enhancement.
For detailed insights into our ESG initiatives, please refer our official website https://www.tciexpress.in. The ESG page, located 
under the “About Us” section, provides an overview of our commitment to ESG principles and sustainable growth, highlighting 
key environmental initiatives and social impact programs. Stakeholders seeking comprehensive information can refer to our ESG 
Profile in the Investor Relations section, which outlines our sustainability performance, governance framework, and ethical business 
practices. Additionally, our ESG Report, also available in the Investor Relations section, offers an in-depth analysis of our ESG 
policies, progress, and future sustainability goals.
Thank you for your continued support.
Sincerely,
Chander Agrawal

1.
Energy
Risk Negative
Energy requirement for logistics companies is very 
intensive, as it requires in warehousing, operational systems, 
offices and to ensure uninterrupted energy supply for cold 
chain logistics, where temperature-controlled storage 
and transport are critical for pharmaceuticals. Logistics 
businesses rely on traditional electricity for warehouses and 
distribution centers and digital infrastructure for tracking 
and route optimization. High energy consumption directly 
affects costs. Beyond financial impact, excessive energy 
use contributes to environmental issues and exposes 
operations to the unpredictability of fuel prices and several 
other risks like: 
High Operation Cost: Increased energy consumption 
leads to higher transportation costs, elevated utility bills, 
and overall higher operational expenses.
Loss of Competitive Advantage: Companies with high 
energy costs may struggle to offer cost-effective services 
compared to energy-efficient competitors and also, 
limiting investment in innovation due to budget constraints.
Resource Depletion: Most of the energy requirement 
are full-filled by traditional fossil fuel, which cause resource 
depletion.
Long-Term Financial Instability: Rising energy costs 
can create budget unpredictability, affecting financial 
planning.
Environmental Concern:  Excessive energy consumption 
contributes to environmental concerns like pollution, 
carbon emissions etc. which cause climate change.
TCI Express has taken several initiatives to reduce its dependency on fossil fuel and improve energy 
efficiency of the Company. Following are the initiatives taken by Company to increase energy efficiency.
Energy Efficiency by Architectural Design
Installation of High-Performance Insulated Material:  To save energy our various ware houses 
roofs are insulated by 50 mm thick, 24 kg/cubic m glass wool protected with aluminum foil, which act 
as heat insulator and lower down 6-8 0C of temperature and reduce the requirement of energy. We 
insulated a total roof area of 8,952.84 sqm at our Indore and Raipur warehouses, which accounts for 
100% of the total roof area.
Installation of Poly-Carbonated Translucent Sheet: The Company has installed 2 mm UV-treated 
translucent polycarbonate sheets to reduce the requirement for artificial lighting during the daytime. A 
total area of 279.2 sqm has been covered with these sheets at the Indore and Raipur warehouses.
Establishment of Green Sorting Centre:  Green buildings enhance energy efficiency through passive 
design, smart technology and renewable energy, minimizing overall consumption. Two of our sorting 
centers are LEED-certified green buildings, while three additional sorting centers under construction are 
being designed to meet green building standards.
Installation of Roof Top Solar Photovoltaic Panels: The Company has installed rooftop solar 
system up-to the maximum limit prescribed by law i.e. 80-90 percent of connecting load. Our two 
sorting centers Tajnagar sorting Centre and Pune sorting center are installed with 600 kWp and 280 
kWp capacity of solar panels. In FY 2024-25 we had generated 942826 KWH of Energy by these two 
solar panels, which is 18% of our total energy consumption. The Company plans to expand its solar panel 
installations to minimize reliance on conventional energy sources. Solar panel installation is currently 
underway at our sorting Centre in Midchal, Hyderabad.
LED Lighting: All traditional lighting is replaced with energy-efficient LED lights.
Investment in Clean Transportation:  Invested in newer, more fuel-efficient vehicles or alternative 
fuel vehicles such as hybrid, or those powered by natural gas.
E-Invoicing for Operational Efficiency: The adoption of e-invoicing leads to notable efficiency gains 
through the elimination of paper-based processes. Digitizing invoicing reduces the need for physical 
documentation, minimizing paper usage and associated energy intensive printing processes.

2.
Emission/ carbon 
footprint
Risk Negative
Transportation is the main activity in our operations and it 
is mostly depended of fossil fuel for powers transportation, 
and a significant amount of fuel used in operations. 
Fluctuations in fuel prices can create financial instability, 
increase transportation costs and reduce profit margins 
and fuel usage leads to higher carbon emissions and cause 
air pollution.
Green Transport and Alternative Clean Fuel to Reduce Emission: The Company is using Eight 
electric vehicles and 155 CNG operated vehicle and we will continue to enhance our e vehicle and clean 
energy vehicle for   implementing more sustainable alternatives of land transportation.
Low Carbon Transport by using Rail Freight:  We prioritize rail usage whenever possible, as it is 
among the most energy-efficient and eco-friendly transportation method as compare to land and air 
transportation. In FY year 2024-25 we had transported 6782 ton of material by railway which reduces 
3845 tCO2e emission, when compare to road mode of transportation. 
Upgrade to Fuel-Efficient Vehicles: The Company has upgraded its fleet by replacing outdated, 
fuel-intensive vehicles with newer, more fuel-efficient models. Currently, the fleet includes 800 BS VI-
compliant vehicles. 
Emission Reduction through Battery Operated Forklift:  To reduce emissions, we have integrated 
lithium-ion battery-operated forklifts into our operations. These forklifts offer approximately 90% 
efficiency, surpassing the 80-85% efficiency of lead-acid batteries. Their zero-emission design 
significantly lowers greenhouse gas emissions. 
Routes Optimization:  Using route optimization system to reduce fuel consumption and emissions by 
minimizing distance traveled and avoiding traffic congestion.
Driver Training Programs: Imparting drivers in echo-driving techniques to reduce fuel consumption.
Regular Maintenance: Ensure vehicles are regularly maintained to operate at peak efficiency.
Compliances: Ensure compliance with all relevant environmental regulations and standards.
3.
Talent Attraction 
and Retention
Opportunity
Positive
Talent attraction and retention are critical for an 
organization’s long-term success because employees 
are its greatest resources and they can impact growth, 
innovation, stability, and competitiveness. Strong talent 
attraction and retention enable companies to build a 
capable and driven workforce, opening doors to innovation, 
efficiency and a competitive advantage. Dedicated 
employees are more inclined to contribute innovative ideas 
and align with the organization’s objectives. A Company’s 
reputation for managing talent plays a significant role in 
attracting top-tier candidates and ensuring a continuous 
flow of skilled professionals.

Cyber security
Risk Negative
With the growing reliance on digital technologies, safeguarding 
against cyber threats and data breaches has become vital for 
protecting sensitive information of both internal and external 
stakeholder information. To address this, the Company has 
consistently invested in technology and security upgrades to 
protect their data and to ensure operational continuity, and 
maintaining trust. Different risk associated with cyber security 
are:
Data Breaches: A data breach can result in the exposure of 
information, leading to financial loss, reputational damage 
and legal consequences.
Financial Losses: Cyberattacks, such as ransomware and 
fraudulent transactions, can lead to substantial financial 
damage, forcing organizations to pay ransoms or suffer 
unauthorized fund transfers.
Disruption 
of 
Operations: 
Cyberattacks 
such 
as 
ransomware can disrupt operations by encrypting critical 
systems or data. This downtime can result in delays, missed 
deliveries and financial losses.
Supply Chain Disruption: A cyberattack on any link 
in the supply chain can disrupt the flow of goods and 
services, leading to delays, increased costs and customer 
dissatisfaction.
Reputational Damage: A cyberattack can severely damage 
Company’s reputation, eroding customer trust and loyalty. 
Business Loss: Loss of customer trust due to security 
breaches can negatively impact business, making it difficult 
to retain customers and attract new business.
Malware & Viruses: Threats like spyware infiltrate systems 
causing data corruption, theft and compromised networks

We are a service provider Company and do not 
manufacture any product therefore we do not have any 
process in place to reclaim, however in alignment with our 
commitment to reduce and recycle our waste we have 
a well define waste management process. This process 
includes a range of activities, including waste collection, 
segregation, recycling through approved vendor and its 
proper disposal. In our business activity waste like plastic 
waste, paper waste, e-waste and solid waste generated, 
which is managed as following manner: 
	
Plastic Waste:  Plastic waste like broken pallet and very 
less quantity of packaging materials is the major source 
of plastic waste in our business operation. In FY 2024-25 
we had recycled all plastic waste through CPCB approved 
vendor. We had recycled 1365 kg of Plastic waste in FY 
2024-25.
	
E-Waste:  Used electronic items are the source of 
E-waste and we had a centralized collection point. From 
there we sent it for recycling through CPCB approved 
recycler. We had recycled 3200 kg in FY 2024-25.
	
Hazardous Waste:  We generate a smaller quantity of 
hazardous waste, which is stored in designated location

is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). 
If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line

As we are service providing Company, we do not generate 
products or packaging waste, making EPR generally 
inapplicable to us. However, our import of two cross belt 
sorter systems included plastic packaging material for our 
sorting center, making EPR applicable in this specific case. 
Accordingly, we have applied for EPR registration on the 
Centralized EPR portal for plastic packaging, provided by 
the CPCB.

and workers to identify potential risk and hazards. 
Through hazard identification and risk management 
system, hazards and risk associated with operating 
heavy machinery, vehicle movement, manual 
handling of materials was identified and proactive 
action is taken to mitigate/minimize the risk and 
hazards.
	
The Company has multiple layers of checks and 
control across the organization and management 
such as conduction of mock drills, daily briefing of 
work to BA on material handling, provision emergency 
exits, fire hydrant system and fire extinguisher for 
fire safety. Regular inspection conducted at the 
workplace to identify potential hazards and ensure 
proactive action and compliance. Our Internal 
Auditor also audits to check the effectiveness of 
OHSMS and identify areas for improvement and also 
conducts inspections of electrical and fire safety 
systems. Additionally, structured training programs 
and awareness are implemented to reinforce safety 
practices and promote a culture of well-being. 
b)	
What are the processes used to identify work-
related hazards and assess risks on a routine 
and non-routine basis by the entity?
	
We have a structured process to identify hazard and 
risk associated with all existing, new and modified 
activities, processes and regulatory changes in 
both routine and non-routine operations. Hazard 
identification involves regular assessments of 
workplace conditions, equipment and operations 
with a focus on recognizing hazard & risks related 
to material handling, ergonomics, environmental 
factors, and operational procedures. In addition to 
routine assessment, non-routine activities such 
as maintenance work and emergency situations 
are also assessed to ensure risk management. 
Risk assessment is conducted systematically using 
different methodology which help to categorize risks 
based on its severity and likelihood.  Participation 
and consultation with relevant personnel involved in 
these activities are ensured during risk assessment. 
After identification and categorization of risk, CAPA 
(‘Corrective and Preventive Action’) is implemented 
to proactively identify risks in high-risk activities 
and hierarchy of control is applied. The hierarchy 
of control starts with elimination whenever feasible, 
followed by engineering controls, administrative 
measures, and use of personal protective equipment 
(‘PPE’s) when necessary. Continuous monitoring 
is maintained through workplace inspections and 
internal audits. Organization has also implemented 
emergency 
preparedness 
plans 
that 
include 
response strategies for fire hazards, medical 
emergencies, and chemical spills, supported by 
mock drills conducted at regular intervals to evaluate 
readiness and enhance effectiveness.

the 
Company 
has 
implemented 
comprehensive 
policies, 
including 
a

vendors, service providers, agents, partners, subsidiaries, 
and affiliates, to adhere to these principles. The Policy 
ensures fair wages, prohibition of forced and child labor, 
work-life balance, protection from harassment, and zero 
tolerance for bribery and corruption. 
	
For addressing concerns related to human rights 
or related matters, the Company has established a 
robust Whistle Blower and Protection Mechanism. This 
mechanism reinforces the company’s commitment to 
integrity and combating unethical practices. It provides 
a platform for stakeholders to report concerns related to 
unethical behavior, fraud (actual or suspected), violations 
of codes of conduct, legal or regulatory non-compliance, 
or misrepresentation in financial statements and reports. 
This is designed to encourage stakeholders to raise 
serious concerns internally before seeking external 
resolution. Stakeholders may report issues by writing to: 
wbpolicy@tciexpress.in. These complaints are overseen 
by the Vigilance and Audit Committee to ensure impartial 
supervision and investigation shall be completed normally 
within 30 days of the receipt of the protected disclosure 
and any delay beyond 30 days will be justified in the 
investigation report.
	
For complete details of the Policy and procedures for 
raising concerns, stakeholders are advised to refer to the 
policy document available at the following link: https://

5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to 
redress grievances related to Human Rights issues
	
As explained above, the Company has established a 
Whistleblower and Protection Mechanism to address 
stakeholder concerns, including issues related to 
human rights. All stakeholders may report unethical or 
inappropriate actions, including but not limited to human 
rights violations, in accordance with the procedures 
outlined under this mechanism. Individuals who wish 
to report concerns as whistleblowers may submit their 
disclosures to the designated Ombudsperson. Disclosures 
can be made in writing via email at wbpolicy@tciexpress.
in, or through written correspondence addressed to the 
Company’s Corporate Office.
	
This mechanism ensures confidentiality, safeguards the 
identity of the whistleblower, and provides protection 
against retaliation, discrimination, or harassment, thereby 
encouraging individuals to raise concerns without fear.
	
Also, employees may raise concerns through the HR- 
One application, which includes a time-bound grievance 
resolution process. Employees also have the option to 
escalate concerns to their reporting managers or consult 
the Legal or HR department, if satisfactory resolution is 
not achieved at the initial level.
	
Additional to this our Open-door policy enables 
employees and workers to have direct access to senior 
management, including the Managing Director, via email. 
While most concerns are resolved at the initial hierarchy 
level, employees who seek further resolution have the 
option to escalate their issues through email, phone, 
or face-to-face meetings. To ensure human rights are 
upheld by our value chain partners the Company enters 
into detailed agreements with all its service providers, 
including suppliers, contractors, and vendors. These 
agreements contain specific provisions mandating 
compliance with human rights regulations for their 
employees and workers. 
	
These internal mechanisms are regularly reviewed to 
ensure effectiveness, transparency, and alignment with 
the Company’s commitment to respecting human rights 
and providing a safe and inclusive work environment.

Yes. We are committed to attain carbon neutrality in 
operations by the year 2038. Accordingly, actions are 
being undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
by investing in energy efficiency and increasing share of 
renewable energy. Some of these measures include: 
Energy Optimization Through Efficiency and Natural 
Light Utilization: Optimisation of energy utilization, 
replacing conventional lighting with LED and utilisation of 
natural light during the day time. The Company has also 
installed 2 mm UV-treated translucent polycarbonate 
sheets at Indore and Nagpur sorting centre to reduce the 
requirement for artificial lighting during the daytime.  
Green Transport and Alternative Clean Fuel to Reduce 
Emission: The Company has integrated electric and CNG-
operated vehicles into its fleet, supporting the transition 
toward green transportation solutions aimed at reducing 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
Fleet Modernization for Enhanced Efficiency and 
Emission Reduction: The Company has replaced outdated, 
fuel-intensive vehicles, with newer fuel-efficient 800 BS VI-
compliant vehicles, ensuring lower emissions and improved 
fuel efficiency. 
Additionally, to further reduce carbon emissions and 
enhance energy-efficient material handling, we have 
integrated lithium-ion battery-operated forklifts into 
our operations. These forklifts offer approximately 90% 
efficiency, surpassing the 80-85% efficiency of lead-acid 
batteries. Their zero-emission design significantly lowers 
greenhouse gas emissions.  
Routes Optimization: Implementation of route optimization 
system enables more efficient fuel consumption and lower 
emissions by strategically minimizing travel distances and 
avoiding traffic congestion. 
Transitioning towards Rail Transport: The Company is 
actively shifting freight transportation from road to rail, a 
strategic move aimed at reducing emissions, improving 
energy efficiency, and enhancing logistical sustainability. 
Enhancing Carbon Sequestration through Plantation: 
In FY 2024-25, the Company has undertaken a large-scale 
afforestation initiative, successfully planting 15,000 plants to 
reduce GHG emission. 
Rooftop Solar Installation at Sorting Centres: The 
Company has installed rooftop solar system up-to the 
maximum limit prescribed by law i.e. 80-90 percent of 
connecting load. Our two sorting centres Tajnagar sorting 
centre, Pune sorting centre are installed with 600 kWp and 
280 kWp capacity of solar panels. 
E-Invoicing for Operational Efficiency: The adoption of 
e-invoicing leads to notable efficiency gains through the 
elimination of paper-based processes. Digitizing invoicing 
reduces the need for physical documentation, minimizing 
paper usage and associated energy intensive printing 
processes. 
Green Sorting centre and use of Eco-Friendly Materials: 
Green buildings enhance energy efficiency through passive 
design, smart technology, and renewable energy, minimizing 
overall consumption. Two of our sorting centers are LEED-
certified green buildings, while three additional sorting 
centers under construction are being designed to meet 
green building standards. Additionally, we utilize climate-
friendly fly ash bricks, which significantly reduce emissions.

proposed project are documented and addressed 
appropriately.
	
Review Meeting and Visit: The Company through 
its CSR arms, evaluates community conflicts that may 
affect the success or progress of a project during review 
meetings. These meetings involve consultations with 
stakeholders, where conflicts are systematically assessed, 
alternative resolutions are explored, and the most 
effective strategies are identified to ensure sustainable 
outcomes. Additionally, review visits are also conducted, 
where these CSR arms engage directly with community 
representatives to discuss concerns, evaluate ongoing 
initiatives, and assess project impact. 
	
Open Dialogue Forum: Our CSR partners have

various 
forum
