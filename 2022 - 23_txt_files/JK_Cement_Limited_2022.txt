Other than as described

applied the Integrated 
Reporting 
Framework 
by 
International 
Integrated 
Reporting 
Council 
(IIRC), 
GRI 
Sustainability Reporting Standards 
(GRI Standards) 
of 
the

Reporting 
Initiative 
(Criteria) and GCCA Guidelines. Such criteria were specifically designed for Integrated

Notice 
EY 
Building a better

We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
limited assurance conclusions. 
Our Independence and Management 
We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of 
the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards 
Board for Accountants, and have the required competencies and experience to conduct this 
assurance engagement. 
EY also applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, Quality Management for 
Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or 
Related Services engagements, which requires that we design, implement and operate a 
system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with 
ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements. 
Description of procedures performed 
Procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from 
and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level 
of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement 
is substantially lower than the 
assurance that would have been obtained had 
a reasonable assurance engagement been 
performed. Our procedures were designed to obtain a limited level of assurance on which 
to base our conclusion and do not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide 
areasonable level of assurance. 
Although 
we 
considered 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
management's 
internal 
controls 
when 
determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not 
designed to provide assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing 
controls or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation of data 
within IT systems. 
A 
limited 
assurance engagement 
consists 
of 
making 
enquiries, 
primarily 
of 
persons 
responsible 
for preparing 
the Integrated 
Report and related information, and applying 
analytical and other appropriate procedures. 
Our procedures included: 
The scope of our work for this assurance engagement was limited to review of information 
pertaining to environmental and social performance for the period 1 April 2022 to 31 
March 2023. The scope and boundaries of the sustainability performance disclosures cover 
JK Cement operations across 
India 
as set out 
in 
the Report 
in the section ‘Reporting 
boundary and scope’. 
We conducted, on 
a sample basis, review and verification of data collection 
/ calculation 
methodology and general review of the logic of inclusion/ omission of necessary relevant 
information/ data and this was limited to:

e

in 
the 
circumstances.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
Cement production is an energy intensive process which consumes thermal energy and electrical energy. The 
basic raw material for manufacturing of cement is limestone which generates GHG emissions (also known as 
process emission) during the heating. Process emissions are responsible for approximately 60% emissions, power 
10% and fuel 30% respectively.
	
JKCL has identified four major levers to reduce the carbon footprint which includes
•	 Energy efficiency measures
•	 Switching from fossil fuel to clean fuel
•	 Switching from fossil power to clean power
•	 Reducing the clinker factor in cement
	
JKCL has committed to Science Based Targets in line with the well-below 2-degree scenario. All the above targets 
are aligned with this target. We plan to cut GHG emissions (Scope 1 + Scope 2) by 21.7% between FY 2019-20 to 
FY 2029-30 by implementing various decarbonization measures. Our action plan focusses on increasing the share 
of green power mix (RE+WHRS) to 75%, decreasing the clinker factor to 65% by producing more blended cement, 
and increasing the TSR to 35% by partially replacing Kiln fossil fuel with Biomass and AFR. JKCL has undertaken 
numerous initiatives for a clean and green technology perspective over the years. We have adopted the best 
technologies available in market on energy efficiency.
