 1
GHG 
Emissions
Risk
Construction 
is 
an 
energy-
intensive activity and generates 
significant direct and indirect 
greenhouse 
gas 
(GHG) 
emissions, 
including 
carbon 
dioxide and methane from fuel 
use. Uncontrolled pollutants and 
emissions during operation and 
associated activities impose legal 
and Environmental risks for the 
Company.
 In order to minimise emissions 
caused by transportation, our 
entity actively encourages the 
adoption of local sourcing for 
raw materials. We also prioritise 
the conversion of Direct Current 
(DC) to Alternating Current (AC) 
for faucet and flush valves, 
thereby 
improving 
energy 
efficiency. Furthermore, we have 
implemented the use of Portland 
Pozzolana Cement (PPC) in all 
non-structural activities, aiming 
to reduce the carbon footprint 
associated with construction 
projects. 
These 
measures 
collectively contribute to our 
commitment to sustainability 
and environmental stewardship.
 Negative

Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Developing and managing real 
estate 
requires 
a 
significant 
reliance on natural resources, 
including 
timber, 
water, 
and 
electricity. Managing the energy 
consumption becomes essential.

Opportunity
Companies 
are

according 
to 
the 
resource

of 
their 
real 
estate 
assets, 
their potential vulnerability to 
environmental construction rules, 
and their efforts to enhance the

their real estate assets.

Climate 
change
Risk
Climate change is impacting 
almost 
all 
geographies 
and 
industries. It can pose physical 
risks such as floods, wildfires 
and 
the 
structural 
integrity 
of infrastructure. It can also 
pose transitional risks such as 
compulsory use of renewable 
energy, change in regulations, etc.
Our entity is dedicated to 
combating 
climate 
change 
through 
various 
measures. 
These 
include 
adopting 
sustainable practices in design, 
technology, and safety systems, 
as 
well 
as 
implementing 
renewable energy sources like 
solar panels. Our goal is to 
make a significant contribution 
in mitigating the impacts of 
climate change.
Negative
5
Water 
Management
Risk
Water 
is 
a 
critical 
resource 
required 
during 
construction, 
operation 
and 
maintenance. 
Water use for various business 
activities impacts the quality and 
quantity of local water resources. 
Improper discharge of water 
can result in contamination of 
water bodies. This may lead to a 
negative impact on operating cost 
may impose a legal risk to the 
Company.
At our projects, we implement 
sewage 
treatment 
plants 
(STPs) to recycle water for 
landscaping, toilet flushes, and 
dust suppression activities. In 
new projects, we aim to install 
smart water meters to monitor 
water consumption effectively. 
We also utilise low-flow taps 
and aerators to minimise water 
flow rates and conserve water 
resources. 
These 
initiatives 
reflect 
our 
commitment 
to 
enhance our sustainable water 
management practices.

Waste 
Management
Risk
The Circular Economy model of 
production 
and 
consumption 
promotes the reusing, refurbishing 
and recycling of existing materials 
and products. The transition to 
a circular economy will affect 
a change in building design 
and material usage. A shift 
in 
regulations 
and 
demand, 
combined with new technology, 
has the potential to reduce costs.
We ensure proper disposal 
of waste materials through 
authorised 
vendors 
and 
implement buyback programs 
for 
batteries. 
Waste 
is 
segregated and managed at a 
centralised facility. We prioritise 
the processing and recycling 
of waste to derive benefits 
from it, as we believe in the 
concept of "Waste is wealth." 
During construction, we handle 
waste 
materials 
responsibly 
and 
strive 
to 
reuse 
them 
whenever possible, promoting a 
sustainable approach.
Negative
7
Employee 
Well-
Being and 
Development
Risk
A higher employee retention rate 
reflects good company policies 
and practices that lead to higher 
employee satisfaction. However, 
a high attrition rate indicates 
low employee satisfaction. High 
attrition also increases the cost 
of replacing and training the 
employees, increases the risk of 
business getting impacted in case 
of critical roles and may reflect 
negatively on investors.
We are a certified "Great Place 
to Work" entity. We focus 
on 
reskilling 
and 
upskilling 
our employees in emerging 
technologies 
through 
digital 
learning initiatives. Identifying 
and retaining critical talent is 
prioritised to keep up with growth 
and competition. Team building 
activities foster a cohesive work 
environment. Health awareness 
programs, including health and

Community 
Engagement
Risk
Construction 
activities 
contributes 
to 
social 
and 
economic development. However, 
they can also create a risk for 
local 
communities 
and 
the 
environment. 
Activities 
such 
as clearing, grading, and the 
use 
of 
hazardous 
chemicals 
can negatively impact the local 
community. In some situations, 
environmental 
concerns 
and 
resistance 
from 
the 
local 
community can lead to project 
delays and, in the worst-case 
scenario, project cancellations. 
This can have a negative impact 
on the Company's profitability 
and the opportunities it has for 
growth.
Our Company actively engages 
with the community through 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) initiatives. We invest 
in 
projects 
and 
activities 
that 
address 
the 
social, 
environmental, and economic 
needs of the communities. 
By 
collaborating 
with 
the 
community, we strive to make 
a positive and lasting impact, 
improving the well-being of 
those around us.
Negative
12
Ethical 
Business 
Conduct
Risk
The key area relevant to business 
ethics is the management of 
issues such as fraud, executive 
misconduct, corrupt practices, 
money laundering, or anti-trust 
violations. Ethics violations can 
lead 
to 
police 
investigations, 
hefty fines, settlement costs, and 
damage to reputation.
We strive to set the standard for 
ethical business conduct with 
our investors, customers, value 
chain partners, and employees. 
We 
prioritise 
transparency 
by providing information on 
ongoing, 
completed, 
and 
upcoming projects. To foster a 
culture of fraud prevention, we 
have implemented an Anti-Fraud 
& Vigilance Policy that involves 
all 
stakeholders 
ensuring 
integrity and accountability.

Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Businesses are assessed based 
on their performance across all 
key governance issues, which 
include 
ownership 
& 
control, 
Board pay, accounting, business 
ethics, and tax transparency. This 
topic examines the effect that a 
company's corporate governance 
and business ethics practices 
have on its shareholders and 
other investors.
We maintain a commitment 
to corporate governance by 
conducting both internal and 
statutory 
audits 
to 
assess 
compliance 
and 
ensure 
adherence 
to 
standard 
operating procedures (SOPs). 
We provide training, manuals, 
and other resources to enhance 
compliance 
awareness. 
Additionally, 
an 
independent 
internal audit team evaluates 
the effectiveness of our risk 
management process, ensuring 
a comprehensive approach to 
risk assessment and mitigation.
Negative
14
Data Privacy 
and Security
Risk
Companies are assessed based 
on the amount of personal data 
they collect, their exposure to 
evolving or increasing privacy 
regulations, their vulnerability to 
potential data breaches, and their 
data protection systems.
To 
enhance 
security 
and 
protect against new threats, 
we have migrated our business 
application from SAP ECC to 
SAP Cloud AWS - S4 HANA 
SAP 
Rise. 
Access 
controls 
are implemented to restrict 
information 
to 
authorised 
personnel. 
We 
have 
also 
transitioned 
to 
Office 
365, 
storing all files in OneDrive for 
improved identity, email, and 
network protection. In terms 
of 
cybersecurity, 
we 
have 
upgraded our endpoint security 
with 
advanced 
software, 
reducing risks and mitigating 
potential 
threats 
to 
both 
endpoint systems and servers.

challenges, targets and 
achievements 
(listed

of this disclosure)
Dear stakeholders ,
As the director responsible for our business responsibility report, it is with great pride and 
enthusiasm that I share our unwavering commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) challenges. At Prestige, sustainability is at the heart of everything we do, and we strive 
to set new industry standards in responsible practices.
One of our primary focuses is on green building practices, which is evident throughout our 
projects’ life cycle. Right from the design stage, we conduct thorough evaluations to identify 
areas for improvement, ensuring that each project aligns with our sustainability goals. We 
have integrated efficient water recycling and waste management practices into our property 
management services after asset handover. This not only minimises our environmental impact 
but also helps create a healthier and more sustainable living environment for our customers.
We are also deeply committed to water conservation, and our efforts include the implementation 
of Sewage Treatment Plants across various locations. By incorporating water flow reducers, 
we not only save water but also enhance user satisfaction, as responsible water usage is a 
collective responsibility.
Responsible waste disposal and smart design elements are integral components of our 
approach to energy efficiency. These measures enable us to optimise energy usage, and we 
are proud to be in compliance with the stringent criteria set forth by IGBC, LEED, and ECBC. 
Our accomplishments are a testament to our enduring dedication to creating a greener and 
more sustainable future for generations to come.
Beyond our environmental commitments, our ESG efforts extend to addressing challenges 
in human rights, diversity, and inclusivity. We believe that fostering a diverse and inclusive 
workforce is essential for long-term success. To this end, we have set ambitious targets and 
implemented transparent communication channels that allow us to understand and address 
the needs of our employees effectively. These efforts have led to significant achievements in 
promoting a harmonious workplace where each individual feels valued and respected. 
At Prestige, we hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards, and our commitment to ethical 
corporate conduct and good governance is unwavering. We recognise that the behaviour of 
our employees significantly impacts our relationships with stakeholders, and therefore, we 
prioritise comprehensive policies that guide and support our people in their day-to-day roles.
As we reflect on our accomplishments, we are inspired to do even more in our journey towards 
sustainability. We are dedicated to continuous improvement and innovation, always striving to 
find new ways to reduce our environmental footprint and positively impact the communities 
we serve.
Thank you for your continued support and trust in our company. Together, we can create a 
brighter and more sustainable future.
Sincerely, 
Director

Grievance Redressal Procedure:
Any complaint lodged verbally by an employee will be treated as a grievance. 
However, grievance will be regarded as formed when the dissatisfaction is given in 
writing. Such disputes which are of a reasonable magnitude arising out of ill feeling 
by an employee or group of employees may be regarded as grievance. The feeling 
of injustice may be related to wages, mode of its payment, leave, transfer, positions, 
promotion, and treatment by superiors, interpretation of code of conduct or even 
the food supplied in the canteen.
The idea of framing the Grievance Redressal Mechanism in the Organisation is to 
solve the problem and the complaints of the employees (Permanent/Temporary). 
Through this mechanism every staff member has the right to express his/her 
grievance and there is a procedure to be followed. The redressal mechanism has 
been formulated taking the following into consideration:
·	
Employees are treated fairly at all times.
·	
Complaints raised by employees are dealt with courtesy and on time.
·	
All complaints are dealt fairly and efficiently.
Complaint Procedure
Employees who have a job-related issue, question, or complaint, he / she should 
follow the following steps:
Step - 1
When an employee faces any grievance, he/she has to report it to his/her immediate 
superior. Such immediate superior officer is expected to give reply or find the 
solution to the grievance within the time stipulated according to the gravity of the 
grievance made.

Yes/No (If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
If the matter is not settled or if the settlement made by him/her is not acceptable 
to the concerned employee, then the employee can directly contact the DC 
(Disciplinary Committee) either through verbal communication or by submitting a 
written application in person or via mail.
The committee investigates on this matter and based on the findings it prepares a 
report to present before the chairperson of the committee who takes decision with 
the help of the submitted report.
If there is any ambiguity in the case a detailed investigation and proceeding for 
expert opinion would be considered.
Step - 2 (If he/she is not satisfied with the decision of DC)
In the second stage, the employee concerned will be permitted to present his/ her 
grievance with the help of co-workers to the ED -HR, IT & Admin who in turn listens 
to the grievance and tries to give a solution and constitutes a committee according 
to the merit of the case or issue put before him.

Briefly 
describe 
the 
waste 
management 
practices adopted in your establishments. 
Describe the strategy adopted by your company 
to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic 
chemicals in your products and processes and 
the practices adopted to manage such wastes .
1) 	
We sort all waste based on its characteristics, categorising 
it into hazardous, non-hazardous, biodegradable, and non-
biodegradable types. The hazardous waste, mainly consisting of 
waste oil from diesel generator sets, as well as paint and varnish 
remnants, is responsibly disposed of through authorised third-
party vendors, following the regulations of the State Pollution 
Control Board.
2) 	
For biodegradable waste, we adopt an eco-friendly approach 
by converting it into organic manure, which we then use for 
landscaping at our operational sites. This practice not only 
prevents the biodegradable waste from ending up in landfills 
but also significantly reduces the release of fugitive methane 
emissions.
3) 	
The wet waste (kitchen waste) is segregated and kept in separate 
Green Bin/Bucket. The wet waste is disposed in green bins with 
lid without lining which will be collected everyday morning.
4) 	
The dry waste like packing materials, paper, wrappers etc 
are disposed in Blue Bin / bucket which will be collected on 
Wednesday and Saturday (second half). 
5) 	
Medical and sanitary waste is wrapped in newspaper and 
disposed in red bins with lid which will be collected everyday 
morning. (Sanitary waste to be sealed properly before disposing 
in red bins).
6) 	
Segregation of mixed garbage is becoming a tough task for the 
house keeping staff to segregate in large quantities, but it is easy 
at the originators (home) level.
7) 	
Organic Waste Compositer (OWC) is used to recycle wet waste.
8) 	
Hotels: We are installing a new drinking water bottling plant to 
reduce use of plastic.
