Data Privacy 
and Cyber 
Security
Risk
Handling sensitive data 
related to RF/microwave 
technologies, digital

software poses significant 
data privacy and cyber 
security risks. Breaches 
could compromise classified 
information, impact 
national security, and lead 
to substantial financial and 
reputational damage. Despite 
robust security measures, 
the evolving cyber threat 
landscape requires ongoing 
vigilance and adaptation to 
safeguard our systems and 
data.
We enhance 
data privacy and 
cyber security by 
deploying advanced 
security measures, 
conducting regular 
assessments, and 
updating protocols 
to counter emerging 
threats. Ongoing 
staff training and 
adherence to 
industry standards 
further safeguard 
our systems and 
data.
