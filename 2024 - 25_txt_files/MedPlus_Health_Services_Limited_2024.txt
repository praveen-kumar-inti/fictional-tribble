Business Responsibility & 
Sustainability Reporting
(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information 
about their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to 
provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of a company’s non-financial impacts and contributions 
to sustainable development. BRSR covers topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and 
governance practices, aiming to promote transparency and accountability.)

1.
Data 
Protection & 
Privacy
Risk
Protecting 
personal 
and 
health information is crucial 
for an omnichannel healthcare 
pharmaceutical retailer. As a 
pharma 
retailer, 
companies 
collect personal data from various 
sources, 
making 
it 
essential 
to prioritize the privacy and 
security of patient and customer 
information.
The company safeguards its 
data from external threats 
by 
implementing 
strong 
firewalls 
and 
regularly 
inspecting its internal IT 
systems to prevent data loss 
or unexpected failures.

Operating with transparency and 
integrity enables the company

With 
a 
focus 
on 
affordability 
and 
employee safety, MedPlus, as 
one of the nation’s largest retail

5.
Product 
Safety & 
Quality
Risk
Maintaining rigorous safety in 
both our products and pharmacy 
dispensing is essential to uphold 
the 
quality 
and 
reputation 
of 
our 
pharmaceutical 
and 
healthcare offerings. But dealing 
in retail medicine chain, there is 
a potential risk of any of the sold 
products do not consistently 
meet 
the 
highest 
safety 
standards.
The 
Company 
primarily 
sources 
its 
products 
from 
pharmaceutical 
manufacturers or authorized 
wholesalers, 
ensuring 
customers receive authentic 
medicines. 
Additionally, 
products 
sold 
under 
the Company’s label are 
manufactured by reputable 
companies 
with 
strong 
quality control systems.
Negative
6.
Responsible 
Marketing
Risk
Responsible marketing involves 
avoiding misleading claims and 
exaggerated promises, especially 
in an industry where many rely 
on over-the-counter medicines. 
There is a risk of damaging our 
reputation and losing customer 
trust 
if 
marketing 
practices 
are misleading or deceptive, 
especially with the company’s 
widespread presence through 
multiple 
stores 
across 
the 
country.
The 
company 
maintain 
transparent communication 
with its consumers and 
adheres to all regulatory 
requirements. The company 
has a strong process in place 
to screen all marketing 
materials 
internally 
and, 
if necessary, with external 
expertise. 
The 
company 
operates a customer helpline 
and continuously monitors 
consumer feedback.

Responsible 
and ethical 
supply chains
Risk
Retail pharmacies must ensure 
products are sourced through 
a licensed, lawful supply chain, 
with systems in place to secure 
uninterrupted 
medication 
dispensing. Sustainable supply 
chain practices help identify 
potential risks and sustainability 
concerns. Failing to do so could 
result in supply disruptions and 
regulatory non-compliance.
The Company sources drugs 
directly from manufacturers 
or wholesalers, minimizing 
the risk of pilferage or 
counterfeiting. Through its 
pharmacy shops, it ensures 
secure

and 
availability 
of

9.
Human 
Rights
Risk
Human 
rights 
encompass 
essential rights and freedoms 
that are universal and should 
be granted to all individuals. 
It 
is 
imperative 
that 
all 
colleagues 
and 
suppliers 
recognize 
this 
commitment 
and regularly evaluate their 
policies 
accordingly. 
Risk 
of 
non-compliance 
with 
human 
rights can lead to consequences, 
including 
legal 
actions, 
reputational damage, and loss of 
consumer trust.
The 
Company 
believes 
in 
providing 
equal 
opportunities 
to 
everybody, 
regardless 
of 
gender, caste, or physical 
limitations. The company 
has standards in place to 
ensure adherence during

MedPlus must manage hazardous

including 
expired 
medicines, and non-hazardous 
waste 
responsibly, 
following 
circular 
economy 
principles 
like 
reduction, 
reuse, 
and 
recycling. This helps minimize 
environmental impact and avoid 
fines for non-compliance with 
waste management regulations.
The Company ensures the 
safe disposal of hazardous 
materials 
through 
third-
party specialists in waste 
disposal. It is also focused on 
reducing waste across the 
supply chain by encouraging 
employees to use reusable 
packaging, such as plastic 
crates, instead of cardboard 
boxes.
Negative
12.
Energy use 
and climate 
impacts in 
Retail
Risk
With numerous retail pharmacies, 
distribution centers, and offices 
nationwide, MedPlus consumes 
significant 
energy, 
primarily 
for lighting and refrigeration. 
Many of these locations operate 
continuously, increasing energy 
demand, much of which comes 
from 
non-renewable 
sources, 
contributing to emissions and 
climate change.
The company procures - 
energy-efficient 
electrical 
equipment and has begun 
to replace all lighting with 
energy-efficient LED lights. 
The Company is always 
monitoring and looking for 
ways to reduce energy use 
across its network.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this 
disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders,
At MedPlus, we believe our purpose goes beyond delivering medicines, we are committed to operating as 
a responsible, inclusive, and sustainable organization. Our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
commitments guide us in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. We acknowledge the sustainability 
challenges in our sector, particularly around energy consumption, emissions, and waste generation. However, 
we view these as opportunities to innovate, lead, and create positive change, not just within our operations but 
across the entire ecosystem.
We have implemented several initiatives to reduce our environmental footprint. These include transitioning 
to LED lighting, exploring the installation of solar panels at warehouses, wherever possible and optimizing 
air conditioning usage resulting in energy savings. Our waste management practices have also evolved, 
we’ve introduced systems for proper waste segregation and recycling. Phasing out the use of plastic bags 
with reusable cloth bags in our retail stores and using recyclable plastic bags and biodegradable covers in 
our warehouse operations. Our supply chain has been restructured to be more localized and efficient, helping 
optimize transportation distances, fuel use, and emissions.
Beyond environmental efforts, we have strengthened our Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) protocols to 
ensure a safe and supportive workplace. We’ve also started calculating our emissions and identifying material 
ESG issues through stakeholder engagement. Our commitment to our people and communities remains strong, 
and we continue to prioritize health, safety, and ethical business practices across all operations.
Looking ahead, we aim to enhance our omnichannel presence, grow private-label offerings, and automate 
backend operations, all aligned with our sustainability goals. While we take pride in our progress, we recognize 
that sustainability is a continuous journey. We remain dedicated to setting higher benchmarks, embracing 
innovation, and driving responsible growth. Thank you for your trust and continued support as we build a 
healthier and more sustainable future together.

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
 
MedPlus’s Code of Conduct explicitly addresses human rights and is rooted in the commitment to

an environment free from discrimination, gender bias, and sexual harassment. Our goal is to create and 
uphold a safe and respectful workplace where civility, dignity, and equal treatment are extended to all—
irrespective of gender, race, caste, creed, religion, origin, sexual orientation, disability, economic status, or 
position in the organizational hierarchy.
 
To support this commitment, we have implemented a Whistleblower Policy and a Prevention and 
Resolution of Sexual Harassment at the Workplace Policy, which empower stakeholders to report any 
misconduct or violations, including those involving either the complainant or the alleged harasser. An 
Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) has been constituted to ensure all harassment-related grievances 
are addressed fairly and promptly. Appropriate corrective actions are taken based on the findings 
of each case.
