Risk
As a Risk: We face challenges in attract-
ing and 
retaining skilled employees. This can 
create difficulties in achieving optimum 
productivity and 
performance
As an Opportunity: Performance can be 
enhanced by using data on the right 
mix of workforce to ensure higher out-
put and provide greater job satisfaction 
and remuneration to ensure retention.
Effective management of climate risk 
is crucial for the well-being of the 
Company
Our processes are labour intensive, and 
we aim to hire from close to our areas 
of operation. This helps in creating sus-
tainable community development. 
We have invested in creating strong 
processes around Quality Checks, 
some of which are driven by regulato-
ry requirements. This creates an entry 
barrier since some of the pre-qualifica-
tions for selling in specific geographies 
are extremely stringent
Dependence on external suppliers for 
raw material, procurement of con-
tainers for export, has a likelihood to 
disrupt the supply of the products of 
the Company, resulting in lower sales 
and negative impact on the Company’s 
reputation.
At Apex, we have 
a strong training 
program to ensure 
that our workers are 
provided with all skills 
they require to effi-
ciently discharge their 
tasks, while also pro-
viding a platform for 
personal enrichment.
While the business is 
subject to vagaries of 
nature, several steps 
are taken to ensure 
that the ecological bal-
ance of the areas we 
work in are maintained
NA
NA
The Company contin-
uously engages with 
multiple farmers to 
ensure that its supply 
chain for raw materials 
is secured. Further, it 
has started expanding 
its suppliers for reefer 
containers for exports.
Negative
Inadequate hiring and re-
tention practices can lead to 
decreased productivity and 
increased costs. 
Positive
Creating a viable work en-
vironment will contribute to 
long-term business success
If we are unable to effec-
tively manage the ecolog-
ical balance, it could lead 
to long-term sustainability 
issues for the business as 
well as the communities we 
operate it, thereby causing 
loss of revenue or disruption 
of operations.
NA
NA
If we are unable to secure 
raw materials in the sizes 
we require, or are unable 
to make timely shipments 
of our finished products, it 
could have a material ad-
verse impact on our results 
of operations and could in-
crease our costs and thereby 
impact our profitability.
