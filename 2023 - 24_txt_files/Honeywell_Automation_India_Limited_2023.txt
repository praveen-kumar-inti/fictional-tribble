Regarding privacy measures, Honeywell has a Data Privacy Function (corporate-wide) which acts as a resource to help 
ensure compliance with global data privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA. 
As part of the Global Data Privacy Standards and Compliance Resources, Honeywell’s Data Privacy Policy establishes 
uniform and global guidance regarding how Honeywell intends generally to Process and protect Personal Data. To the 
extent that Law or contractual provisions impose stricter requirements than the guidance set in the Policy, Honeywell will 
comply with the more restrictive Law or contractual provisions. 
Honeywell has a data privacy policy (Policy 2006). Policies are proprietary and cannot be shared but can be demonstrated.
Further information on Honeywell’s data privacy can be found on Honeywell’s Data Privacy Trust Center : 
https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/company/data-privacy

There were no such complaint received by the Company.
For cybersecurity corrective actions, Honeywell provides centralized configuration management in which configurations 
common across multiple systems are stored in a repository, versioned, and deployed. Baseline configuration settings for 
all IT products are documented in build books.
Changes to the configuration settings are monitored and controlled through the technical configuration process using 
a host/client scanner that connects to hosts and collects the configuration information from operating systems. The 
configuration settings are then compared to the baseline located on the server and flagged accordingly. Corrective actions 
are taken to remediate/mitigate the gaps found.
Patching is performed at regular intervals dependent on the device. All changes, including patches related to infrastructure 
and applications within the production environment, are managed in a controlled manner. Changes are logged, assessed, 
and authorized prior to implementation and reviewed against planned outcomes following implementation. This assures 
risk mitigations do not negatively affect the stability or integrity of the production environment.
7.	 Provide the following information relating to data breaches: 
a.	 Number of instances of data breaches along-with impact
b.	 Percentage of data breaches involving personally identifiable information of customers
