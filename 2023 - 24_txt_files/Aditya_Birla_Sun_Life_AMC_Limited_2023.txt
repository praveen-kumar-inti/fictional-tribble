(Indicate positive or

Corporate 
Governance
Risk
In corporate governance, key issues 
for the AMC sector include those 
related to ethical and responsible 
business conduct, anti-bribery 
measures, and compliance with 
evolving regulatory requirements 
and disclosures. The dynamic 
nature of the regulatory landscape, 
markets, and product offerings 
poses a risk of insufficient 
understanding and prompt 
response to these changes. 
Moreover, the growing emphasis 
on governance, compliance, and 
ESG disclosures necessitates the 
company’s attention to emerging 
ESG-related risks.
The company has established a 
comprehensive framework on 
corporate governance, featuring 
well-documented policies, including 
a whistle-blower policy. With an 
inclusive code of conduct applicable 
to all employees, ABSLAMC has 
cultivated an environment aimed 
at minimising governance and 
compliance risks. Additionally, the 
company conducts regular training 
sessions and monitors ongoing 
performance to ensure adherence 
to these policies. This includes 
specialised training programs for 
directors, equipping them with the 
knowledge of regulatory changes, 
policies affecting the company’s 
business, and emerging regulatory 
developments.
Negative:
In the event of challenges arising in 
the management of the company’s 
governance practices and 
adherence to compliance-based or 
regulatory requirements, there is a 
potential for a negative impact on 
the company, affecting:
1.	
ESG ratings
2.	
The ability to attract 
additional investment in the 
business from responsible 
or ESG-aware investors 
(Including global investors).
Digitalisation Opportunity
For the AMC sector, digitalisation 
can contribute towards enhancing 
efficiency, improving client 
experiences, enabling access to 
global markets, and fostering 
innovation,
Embracing digital transformation 
can prove essential to remain 
competitive and succeed in 
an increasingly digitised and 
interconnected world for long-term 
success.
The company has continuously 
invested in adapting its systems 
in line with technological 
advancements and established 
a strong digital infrastructure 
– including to minimise the use 
of paper for transactions and 
communications.
This includes e-KYC, e-Sign 
authentication, and employing 
analytical models to drive 
data-informed decisions for 
investments. 
Negative:
Issues or limitations in managing 
digitalisation of processes can 
adversely affect turnaround 
time (TAT), grievance resolution, 
and thus customer satisfaction 
levels, as well as cyber security 
risks. Each of these factors can 
potentially negatively affect the, 
the reputation of the Company, 
its customer base, and financial 
performance.

Risk 
Management
Opportunity
The company views effective risk 
management as a crucial element 
of business management, essential 
for achieving business goals 
and objectives. In the course of 
business, the company encounters 
various risks, including strategic, 
investment, operational, and ESG-
related risks and opportunities. 
Over time, the company has 
continuously enhanced its Risk 
Management Framework to 
monitor and mitigate these risks. 
There is an ongoing opportunity for 
the company to continue to update 
its risk management framework 
and associated practices and 
policies, to adapt and align them 
with regulatory requirements and 
the evolving landscape of the AMC 
industry.
Supported by well-established 
protocols and processes, the 
company has established a resilient 
enterprise risk management 
framework. This framework 
incorporates strategies and 
protocols for risk identification, 
risk assessment, risk response, and 
an overarching risk management 
strategy.
Through the implementation of 
this robust risk management 
framework, the company 
has showcased its dedication 
to ethical conduct and good 
governance across its business and 
operations. In addition to adhering 
to regulatory requirements, 
the company has proactively 
incorporated industry best 
practices in risk management.
Presently, the company also has 
a Responsible Investment Policy 
specifically for the ‘Aditya Birla Sun 
Life ESG Fund’.
Positive:
The company’s robust risk 
management framework has 
enabled it to overcome key 
risks and challenges across the 
short, medium and long term. 
The company also believes that 
its commitment to address 
and mitigate ESG-related risks 
is demonstrated through its 
initiatives in responsible investing. 
Through such efforts taken on 
risk management, the company 
aims to contribute to its overall 
financial stability and focus on the 
sustainability. .
Data Privacy 
and Cyber 
Security
Risk
In the realm of data privacy 
and security management, 
the Company faces a notable 
challenge in the form of 
cybersecurity-related risks. These 
risks predominantly involve the 
possibility of weakening or failure 
of the Company’s information 
technology (IT)-based resources 
and systems. Given the increasing 
incidence of cybersecurity threats, 
some of the identified risks include:
1.	
Ransomware
2.	
Phishing
3.	
Associated loss or wiping out 
of proprietary data or critical 
information.
The Company continues to 
recognise these risks as having the 
potential to significantly impact 
its operations, reputation, and 
profitability.
The company has given 
considerable importance to 
the issue of data privacy and 
cybersecurity, taking steps to 
identify, address, and mitigate 
associated risks. In line with this 
commitment, data privacy and 
cybersecurity risks have been 
explicitly included in the Risk 
Management Policy. Furthermore, 
the company has adopted 
measures to actively reduce 
these risks and their potential 
impact. These measures include 
regular testing of its IT systems, 
implementation of effective 
firewalls, and consistent and 
thorough reviews of its IT systems, 
processes, and assets.
Negative:
The company faces the potential 
of incurring increased costs 
to efficiently oversee and 
ensure timely updates to its IT 
infrastructure, systems, and 
processes, which may include 
expenses associated with system 
upgrades.

Management,

Opportunity 
The Company views talent 
management, employee well-
being, and diversity and inclusion 
as key priority areas improving 
organisational sustainability.
The company understands 
employees’ role and their 
interconnectivity with the 
Company’s growth, value creation 
and long-term sustainability.
The Company consistently invests 
in the holistic overall well-being 
of its workforce, and aims to 
create a diverse and inclusive 
environment. Our focus remains on 
fostering a work environment that 
promotes work-life balance, holistic 
well-being, and a commitment 
to nurturing the mental and 
physical health of its workforce. 
The company continues to offer 
comprehensive health and wellness 
programs to its employees.
Positive:
The Company’s active interest and 
investment in talent management, 
employee well-being, and diversity 
and inclusion can prove to be a 
value-add, especially in the long 
term.
A diverse and healthy workforce 
can help the Company further

succession planning and business 
growth pursuits, and help it to 
contribute to the professional and 
personal well-being and growth of 
its workforce
