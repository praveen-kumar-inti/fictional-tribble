a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
	
	
Yes, the Company has procedures in place for sustainable sourcing in the form of buy back and exchange of old 
jewellery.
	
	
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
	
	
The Company’s raw materials consist of gold (bullion) and diamonds. These items do not deteriorate with time and 
can be reused again and again. The Company therefore encourages recycling and exchange of jewellery wherein 
its customers bring in their old jewellery to exchange the same for fresh items. The Company also buys back old 
jewellery. This ensures that the Company’s demand for the fresh raw material is reduced considerably. In FY 2022-23 
more than 70% of the Company’s requirement of raw materials was met by recycling of old jewellery. The fresh gold 
bars consumed are procured from suppliers who in turn procure the same from RBI designated banks which import 
London Bullion Market Association certified gold ensuring highest purity and quality.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of 
life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) Other waste:
(a)	 Plastics (including packaging): The Company has almost eliminated use of any type of plastics in its operations, 
including packaging.
(b)	 E-waste: Not Applicable, as the Company does not generate any e-waste.
(c)	 Hazardous waste: Not Applicable, as the Company does not generate any hazardous waste.
34 | Annual Report 2022-23
PC JEWELLER LIMITED
(d)	 Other waste: The Company’s raw materials consist of fresh gold bars, recycled gold and cut & polished diamonds. Cut 
& polished diamonds are not processed in any manner but studded in the jewellery as such. In case of gold, its purity is 
reduced from 24kt to 22 kt which actually increases its physical quantity. The gold waste generated during conversion 
of gold in jewellery is collected back to minimize any loss as it is also a very high value item.
	
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the 
waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control 
Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
