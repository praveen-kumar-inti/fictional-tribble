Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR)
 FOREWORD
As a responsible corporate citizen, Supreme Petrochem Limited (SPL) remains committed to create long-term value for 
all stakeholders by embedding sustainability and ethical practices into our core operations. The Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for the financial year 2024-2025 reflects our ongoing efforts to integrate Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations into our strategic decision making.
In a rapidly evolving global environment, businesses are increasingly expected to go beyond financial performance and 
contribute positively to the environment, society, and the economy. At SPL, we recognize this responsibility and have 
taken concrete steps to align our business goals with the principles of sustainable development.
This report outlines our performance across nine essential principles defined under the National Guidelines on 
Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC). While we acknowledge that there is always more to be done, we remain 
steadfast in our commitment to continuous improvement, transparency, and responsible growth. We view sustainability 
not as a compliance requirement but as a strategic imperative that defines the future of our business.
SPL, as a responsible organization, has always focused on inclusive growth for all its stakeholders along with 
enhancing its business operations in a sustainable manner. The Company aims to continue strengthening its ESG 
efforts consecutively to accelerate the embedding of sustainability in its business ecosystem to place SPL on a positive 
trajectory with regards to achieving sustainability across all operations. SPL strives to continue its business operations 
across the value chain in an ethical, responsible, and sustainable manner.
I thank all our stakeholders for the trust and support reposed by them in the Company. Together, we will continue to drive 
progress, innovate responsibly, and contribute to a more sustainable and equitable future.

8.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details
	
Yes. Recognizing its environmental impact, SPL endeavours to diminish its ecological footprint by undertaking initiatives to 
mitigate Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. These initiatives include adopting energy-saving LED lighting, utilizing energy-
efficient equipment like induction motors and compressors, and implementing Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) systems. 
SPL also primarily uses cleaner fuels such as natural gas and low sulphur heavy stock for its thermal energy demands in 
the manufacturing operations. The Company uses battery operated vehicles such as forklift trucks, at its manufacturing 
locations. SPL has installed a 1 MWp solar roof top power plant at its manufacturing unit at Amdoshi to bolster the share of 
renewable energy in fulfilling the electrical energy demands of the operations. SPL has also increased its renewable energy 
usage even more to reduce GHG emissions by entering into a Power Delivery Agreement with TP Saturn Limited (a Special 
Purpose Vehicle (SPV) formed by Tata Power Renewable Energy Limited) for supplying 12.5 MW solar power to the Amdoshi 
Unit of the Company.
