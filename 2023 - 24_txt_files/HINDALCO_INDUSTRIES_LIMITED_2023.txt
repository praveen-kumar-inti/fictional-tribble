Financial implications 
of the risk or

positive or negative 
implications)
1
Energy and GHG  
Emissions Management
R
Coal is one of the primary sources of 
energy for Indian operations. Being 
a continuous process industry,with 
dependence on coal, it is challenging to 
replace coal with any alternate material 
in the near-term, making it cost intensive.
• Reducing the dependency on nonrenewable 
energy sources by adding a cumulative 173 MW of 
renewable energy capacity (as on 31st March 2024).
•  We are also evaluating the feasibility of other energy 
sources including increasing the use of biomass in 
power plants.
•  We have also been working on carbon capture as 
well as energy storage.
Negative Implications
2
Waste and Hazardous 
Waste Management
R
To protect the environment, it is essential 
to properly dispose of waste from 
operations. Some of the waste is stored 
in a secure area, for which substantial 
land is required. The availability of land 
is becoming difficult and the storage of 
waste in the ponds is also subject to its 
own risks. For our operations, compliance 
with the evolving regulatory requirements 
in a specified time frame shall be a 
prerequisite.
•  We have set up a year-on-year target of 5% for 
recycling and reusing generated waste, with the 
aim to achieve zero waste to landfill by 2050. We 
have been using green-technology innovation in 
waste reuse and metal recycling across our India 
operations.
• We have taken several initiatives in partnerships to 
reuse bauxite residue for backfilling, road building 
and establishing long-term contracts with cement 
and road developers. These initiatives are being 
monitored regularly.
Negative Implications

Financial implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity (Indicate 
positive or negative 
implications)
3
Water Management
R
Natural resource depletion is a risk across 
the world. We depend on the supply of 
coal, bauxite, copper concentrate, water 
and so forth. Four of our plants are in the 
water stress area. This can have a lasting 
impact on our immediate environment 
and operations. 
•  Implementation of measures such as reusing 
and recycling of used water will aid in reducing 
dependency on freshwater. Thus, ensuring that the 
needs of the community are not compromised
•  We have planned several initiatives for water 
recycling and rainwater harvesting at various plants. 
Our aim is to achieve zero liquid discharge and water 
positivity across mining and downstream verticals by 
2025.
Negative Implications
4
Air Emissions
R
Our non-GHG air emissions result from 
both fuel combustion and production 
processes. Our aluminium smelting 
process contributes to fluoride emissions 
while the burning of fossil fuels contributes 
to Oxides of Sulphur (Sox), Oxides of 
Nitrogen (NOx) and Particulate Matter 
(PM).
•  Adoption and implementation of innovative 
technologies along with reduced coal consumption 
will facilitate reducing air emissions
• We have installed Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) 
units at Mahan, Aditya, and are in the process of 
installing at Renusagar. 
Negative Implications
5
Biodiversity
R
Our operations depend on coal and 
bauxite mines. Further, many of our 
locations are situated near areas of 
high biodiversity. Proper management 
of biodiversity around our operations is 
critical for continued operations at our 
locations.

Health and safety is of utmost importance. 
However, we face injuries due to safety 
related risks in our manufacturing 
processes.
•  Implementation of various initiatives and 
programmes to increase health and safety related 
awareness among work and reduce risk of hazards 
and accidents, such as ‘Serious Injuries and Fatality 
(SIF) Prevention Programme’, a unique initiative 
which standardises contractor safety management

Economic Performance
O
We have been able to achieve our 
deleveraging target in a timely manner 
leading to a strong balance sheet. This

the shareholders and lenders. We have a 
robust approach to the capital allocation 
framework. Further, our focus has been 
on maximising shareholder return by 
prioritising our growth capital expenditure 
towards value added downstream 
expansion projects.
