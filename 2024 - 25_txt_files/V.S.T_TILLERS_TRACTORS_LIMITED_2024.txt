(Indicate positive 
or negative 
implications)
1
GHG and 
Climate 
Change
R
VST heavily depends on 
non-renewable fuel and 
energy, contributing to GHG 
emissions. Climate change 
poses risks, such as reduced 
agricultural productivity, 
extreme weather costs, 
changing market demands, 
and regulatory changes. 
Physical risks like floods, 
droughts, and heatwaves 
could disrupt operations, 
while dependence on non-
renewable energy might 
damage the company’s 
reputation.
VST focuses on energy 
efficiency and renewable 
energy. Initiatives include 
energy audits, LED lights, 
power factor panels, and 
solar power at plants. The 
company also reduces 
emissions by adopting 
green technologies and 
has planted 71 trees in 
Mysore, 471 trees in Malur 
and 1038 trees in Hosur.
Negative
2
Waste 
Management
R
VST 
generates 
non-
hazardous waste (e.g., metal 
scrap, packaging, and coating 
waste). Improper handling 
can harm ecosystems, cause 
non-compliance issues, and 
damage reputation.
VST has implemented 
waste 
management 
programs 
to 
ensure 
compliance and improve 
recycling. Future efforts will 
focus on reducing waste 
generation and increasing 
material reuse.

Water 
Management
R
Water scarcity due to 
droughts, extreme weather, 
and rising demand impacts 
VST operations, particularly 
in water-scarce regions. 
Hazardous wastewater also 
requires treatment.
VST optimizes water use, 
employs touch sensors, 
and 
reuses 
water. 
Rainwater is collected, and 
the company maintains 
zero-discharge facilities. 
Wastewater is treated 
and recycled for use in 
gardening, with sludge 
used as fertilizer.
Negative

Reducing 
Life Cycle 
Emissions
O
Agriculture 
contributes 
significantly 
to 
GHG 
emissions, making it crucial 
to focus on mitigation. 
VST can reduce life cycle 
emissions by improving 
fuel efficiency and adopting 
renewable energy solutions.
NA
Positive
5
Sustainable 
Supply Chain
R
Effective sourcing and 
managing ESG risks within 
the supply chain are vital 
for VST. Failure can result in 
legal penalties, reputational 
harm, and supply chain 
disruptions, which can affect 
long-term sustainability.
VST has implemented a 
Supplier Risk Management 
and Mitigation (SRMM) 
process, 
developed 
supplier capacity, and is 
creating a supplier code 
of conduct with ESG 
parameters.
Negative
6
Human 
Rights 
Management
R
Non-standard human rights 
practices (e.g., forced labor, 
unsafe conditions) could 
harm employees and tarnish 
the company’s reputation. 
Fair wages and proper 
benefits are essential to 
avoid social unrest.
VST ensures compliance 
with human rights laws 
through its sustainability 
policies and Code of 
Business 
Conduct, 
promoting 
employee 
integrity and mitigating 
human rights risks.
Negative
7
Occupational 
Health & 
Safety
R
VST’s operations expose 
workers to health and 
safety risks due to heavy 
loads and precision tasks. 
Failure to mitigate these 
risks could reduce efficiency 
and increase compliance 
burdens.
VST 
provides 
PPE 
guidelines, health services 
(eye check-ups and blood 
tests), and promotes 
safety standards to reduce 
health and safety risks for 
employees and workers.
Negative

Employee 
Satisfaction

PRINCIPLE 9 Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner.
(This principle highlights the importance of responsible consumer engagement. Companies should provide safe, high-quality 
products and services, and ensure that they are marketed and sold ethically and responsibly. They should also be transparent 
about their products and services, and provide consumers with the information they need to make informed choices.)
Essential Indicators
1. 	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
The company has a dedicated service team to handle consumer complaints, with a system in place to promptly collect 
and address all consumer issues. For product complaints related to tractors after delivery, the process involves reporting 
the tractor to the dealership, where complaints are logged through a job card.
	
The complaint attending process at the dealership or RSO starts when the tractor is received from either the RSO or 
direct billing from the plant. A Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI) is conducted on the same day, and any shortages or defects 
found are immediately reported to VST via a PDI job card. Complaints are recorded through a job card, and a Product 
Concern Intimation Report (PCIR) is generated for the issues raised. Upon approval, the dealer undertakes the necessary 
work to resolve the complaint.
	
Complaint Attending Process at HO:
	
•	
PDI (Pre-Delivery Inspections): Job card is created.
	
•	
QCRS (Quality Concern Review System): Based on the severity of the PCIR (number of complaints reported), QCRS 
is raised.
	
•	
CFT (Cross-Functional Team): A CFT member reviews complaints and escalates them to the ORC.
	
•	
CAR (Corrective Action Report): Once a complaint is closed, CAR is released by the QA team.
	
•	
ORC (Operations Review Committee): The complaint is tracked in the ORC, and revised actions are taken to 
ensure closure.
	
•	
END: Once CAR is released from the Service Department, a Technical Bulletin is issued, detailing the actions taken.
	
Additionally, the customer care team is responsive to customer feedback, which plays a crucial role in our continuous 
improvement process and ensures that we maintain our commitment to providing excellent customer service.
