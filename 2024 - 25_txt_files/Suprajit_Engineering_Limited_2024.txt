Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social 
matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate 
the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format:
Sl.

(R / O)
Rationale for identifying 
The risk / opportunity
In case of risk, approach to

Financial 
implications 
of the risk or

(Indicate 
positive or 
negative 
implications)
1
Waste 
Management 
& Circular 
Economy
Opportunity
Embracing circular 
economy principles 
through waste reduction, 
reuse, and recycling 
helps minimize landfill 
dependency and 
promotes resource 
efficiency.
Implement 3R strategies (Reduce, 
Reuse, Recycle), Monitor 
hazardous waste handling 
practices Train employees on 
waste segregation and Engage 
with authorized recyclers and 
disposal vendors
Negative Impact
2
Energy 
Consumption
Risk
Energy costs form a 
significant portion of 
operational expenditure. 
Fluctuations in energy 
prices and regulations 
can impact profitability.
This is managed through 
forecasting of potential regulatory 
impacts on our costs and initiating 
mitigation action to reduce 
this through our operational 
performance, including energy 
efficiency investment, long term 
price modelling and energy 
procurement and renewable 
electricity targets.
Negative Impact
3
Reduce Carbon 
Footprint
Opportunity
Minimizing carbon 
emissions is vital to 
addressing climate 
change and meeting 
evolving environmental 
compliance standards. 
It also creates 
opportunities to boost 
operational efficiency, 
lower costs, and position.
We are actively working to lower 
its carbon footprint by integrating 
energy efficient technologies in 
operations, streamlining logistics 
to cut transport-related emissions, 
and prioritizing procurement 
of renewable and sustainable 
materials. Further, we promote 
a culture of environmental 
consciousness through employee 
engagement initiatives focused on 
climate action.
Positive Impact
4
Cybersecurity & 
Data Protection
Risk
Increasing digitalization 
exposes the company 
to data breaches and 
cyber threats, potentially 
affecting customer data, 
internal systems, and 
compliance.
We have adopted multi-layered 
data security protocols, conducts 
regular IT audits, and ensures 
employee training on data 
protection. Our IT department 
actively monitors vulnerabilities 
and maintains incident response 
mechanisms.
Negative Impact
5
Occupational 
Health & Safety
Risk
Ensuring a safe working 
environment is critical. 
Workplace accidents can 
disrupt operations and 
affect employee morale 
and compliance status.
We follows strict EHS guidelines 
across all manufacturing units. 
Regular safety audits, safety 
training sessions, PPE usage 
monitoring, and root cause 
analysis of incidents help mitigate 
health and safety risks.
Negative Impact
