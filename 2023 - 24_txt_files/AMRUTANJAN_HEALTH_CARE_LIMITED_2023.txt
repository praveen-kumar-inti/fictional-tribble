Message from 
the Chairman & 
Managing Director
The key takeaway from the year in review is our return to 
growth! Your management team delivered a double digit 
growth in revenue and profit despite softened demand in 
our core pain relief segment.
The COVID years witnessed an above average 
consumption of topical pain relief products followed by 
a sharp decline in the years after, resulting in a build-up 
of channel stock, which is being gradually optimized. 
While there was a pronounced spike in consumption of 
all types of pain relievers (topical and oral), there was a 
noticeable shift toward oral analgesic. This trend seems 
to have continued during the post-COVID period till date, 
wherein use of tablets to relieve headaches is higher than 
that of balms indexed at the same level (source: IQVIA). 
Nevertheless, the headache relief category bounced back 
to high single-digit growth in the current year, and we 
project annualized volume and value growth for the mid-
term to be in the range of 9-10%. 
A compelling insight from our data reveals that 
headaches are experienced most by those under 30,  
likely a consequence of increased screen time, career 
pressures, and the demands of modern lifestyles. While 
this demographic is less inclined to use topical balms, 
they are showing growing interest in our Headache Roll-
on—a modern, portable, and health-conscious alternative 
to tablets.
The topical body pain relief category is outpacing the 
headache relief segment, with our brands experiencing 
comparable growth. We are committed to dedicating 
resources and time to expanding our market share in this 
promising area.
Our women’s hygiene business continues to grow in 
the high double-digits, owing to higher acceptance 
of our uniquely designed sanitary pads. The BIS 
standards mandated  by the Government of India require 
certain levels of performance—which our products 
seamlessly meet, underscoring our commitment to 
consumer satisfaction.
The average temperature in India has risen by almost 
0.7 degrees Celsius between 1961 and 2020 according 
to the World Bank Climate Change Portal, bringing 
with it, a myriad of health challenges to its citizens. 
With temperatures set to rise in the decades to come, 
hydration will become a critical preventive health need. 
The increase in number of people adopting healthy, active 
lifestyles is also acting as a catalyst for the electrolyte 
drink category. Our brand, ‘Electro+’ in its ready-to-drink 
format, offers the highest electrolytes and energy per 
200ml, complemented by palette-pleasing juice flavors.
We believe corporates have a role in reducing their carbon 
footprint, and to this effect, we have set goals for plastic 
reduction and green energy consumption. 
Dear Valued Owners,
As a value-based organization, purpose is our North star 
– and our selection of categories and strategies reflect 
this. Our CSR funds are a testament to this commitment, 
supporting NGOs focused on girl child education and 
animal welfare.
Looking ahead, our goal is not just to achieve the ₹10 
billion milestone but to strengthen our legacy as a 
trusted leader in the healthcare and wellness sector. As 
we continue to evolve, we remain focused on delivering 
solutions that enhance the well-being of our consumers. 
Together, we will build a future where Amrutanjan stands 
as a reliable partner of trust in providing health and 
wellness products.

to enable e-voting to all the demat account holders, by way of a single login credential, through their demat accounts/ 
websites of Depositories/ Depository Participants. Demat account holders would be able to cast their vote without 
having to register again with the ESPs, thereby, not only facilitating seamless authentication but also enhancing ease and

rise of e-commerce and digital marketing strategies 
enabling companies to reach a broader audience and 
enhance consumer engagement. Digitalization in the 
FMCG sector is expected to accelerate in 2024, driven 
by technology investments that boost efficiency and 
growth. Emerging markets are also expected to be 
significant contributors to FMCG growth in 2024, with 
regions such as Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Africa 
projected to see increased consumer spending due to 
rising disposable incomes and urbanization. 
 
In India, the FMCG sector is set for robust growth 
in FY24, with projected revenue growth of 7-9%. 
This growth is attributed to higher volumes, a revival 
in rural demand, and steady urban consumption. 
The positive outlook highlights the industry's resilience 
and growth potential. In the first quarter of FY24, the 
Indian FMCG sector registered a 6.6% growth, driven by 
stable consumption and rising demand in rural areas. 
Despite past challenges, rural markets are showing 
signs of recovery, contributing to overall market growth.
 
The sector continues to face challenges such as 
inflationary 
pressures 
and 
fluctuating 
consumer 
confidence. 
However, 
government 
initiatives 
and 
favorable economic policies are expected to support 
industry growth. The Union Budget 2024, with its 
focus on agriculture and infrastructure, is likely 
to provide additional support for the FMCG sector. 
Non-food segments, particularly home care categories, 
are expected to perform well, driven by increasing 
consumer awareness and demand for hygiene products, 
reflecting the global shift towards health and wellness.
 
Category Overview
 
The rubefacients category, after a de-growth in FY23, 
bounced back with a double-digit value growth in 
FY24 due to improved volume offtake. In fact, it was 
the second highest in the past five years, after the 
growth during peak COVID-19 in FY22–the same trend 
was seen in volume growth as well. This indicates that 
the growth is consumption-driven and the category is 
coming back to normalcy after hitting its peak during 
the second wave of the pandemic.
 
In FY24, the rubefacients category was valued at ₹6,612 
crore. Amrutanjan Health Care Limited (AHCL’s) volume 
growth outperformed the category, achieving a growth 
rate approximately 1.1 times that of the category.

same trend; after a decline in FY23, it witnessed a 
double-digit value growth in FY24. The category was 
valued at ₹1,723 crore from ₹1,564 crore in the previous 
year. The Company experienced superior growth 
throughout most of FY24 compared to the Headache 
category. AHCL’s volume growth was higher than the 
Headache category in three out of four quarters in FY24.
 
After experiencing negative growth in FY23, the Body 
Ache category achieved a healthy double-digit growth 
rate in FY24, surpassing the ₹3,000 crore mark. 
Though AHCL has a relatively smaller base in this space, 
the volume growth was higher than the category, across 
all quarters of FY24.
 
The category trends were also evident in internal sales, 
with secondary growth observed in both the Headache 
and Body ache segments, consequently impacting 
primary sales positively

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND 
ANALYSIS REPORT
Economic Overview
Global Economy
Over the past two years, the impact of the Covid-19 
pandemic on lives and livelihoods has diminished. This period 
has been marked by significant events, including supply 
chain disruptions and the Russia-Ukraine war, which 
triggered a global energy and food crisis and a surge in 
inflation. The period also saw globally synchronized monetary 
policy tightening. 
According to the IMF’s "World Economic Outlook April 2024" 
report, the global economy is resilient, with steady growth 
and inflation returning to target. The forecast for global 
economic growth is stable at 3.2% for 2024 and 3.3% for 2025. 
Inflation in emerging markets is expected to remain higher 
and decline more slowly compared to advanced economies. 
Trade policy uncertainty remains high due to major elections.
A significant share of global growth in 2024 is anticipated 
to come from Asia, despite China's weaker-than-expected 
recovery, sustained weakness in the USA, higher energy 
costs in Europe, and weak global consumer sentiment driven 
by the Ukraine-Russia war and the Red Sea crisis, which have 
led to higher logistics costs. Tightening monetary policies 
have resulted in increased policy rates and higher interest 
rates for new loans.
Emerging markets and developing economies showcased 
resilience, benefiting from shifts in global supply chains and 
trade tensions. The IMF projects these economies to grow 
by 4.3% in 2023, outpacing their advanced counterparts. 
Amidst these global dynamics, India stands as a bright spot.
The global healthcare industry in 2024 is marked by 
significant 
advancements 
and 
ongoing 
challenges. 
The sector is experiencing a resurgence in spending due to 
a recovering global economy and increased investments in 
health technology, digital therapeutics, and data sharing 
practices. Key trends include the adoption of artificial 
intelligence, telemedicine, and personalized medicine, which 
are transforming healthcare delivery and improving patient 
outcomes. However, the industry continues to grapple with 
healthcare worker shortages, regulatory complexities, and 
disparities in access to care. Innovations in care models and 
virtual healthcare are pivotal in addressing these challenges 
and shaping the future of healthcare.
In its latest Economic Outlook, the OECD describes that the 
global economy is maintaining steady progress. However, the 
economic landscape is becoming more complex, with both 
opportunities and risks. The risk of elevated inflation has 
increased the likelihood of prolonged high interest rates, 
raising external, fiscal, and financial risks. Projections indicate 
a decrease in global headline inflation to 5.7% in 2023, further 
dipping to 3.9% in 2024. Monetary policy tightening by central 
banks like the Federal Reserve and the European Central 
Bank has raised debt servicing costs, especially for nations 
with foreign currency-denominated debts. Effective policy 
action is essential to ensure macroeconomic stability and 
enhance medium-term growth prospects.
Indian Economy
India's economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience 
amidst global challenges and geopolitical tensions, driven 
by strong domestic demand, substantial investments, 
and dynamic growth in manufacturing and services. 
The estimated Real GDP growth rate for FY24 is 8.2%, up from 
7.0% in FY23, highlighting the country's robust economic 
framework and the effectiveness of its growth strategies. 
India is on track to become the third-largest economy within 
the next three years.
Corporate balance sheets are largely de-leveraged and 
healthy, with private investments on track. Inflation is nearing 
the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) target of 4%, with forex 
reserves at record levels. The National Statistics Office (NSO) 
reported a retail inflation rate of 5.09% in February 2024, 
which eased to 4.85% in March 2024. The fiscal deficit is 
expected to stay within the 5.1% target for FY25. In FY24, 
the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation averaged 5.4%, 
with rural inflation exceeding urban inflation.
FY24 saw a milestone with gross GST collections of 
₹20.18 lakh crore, up 11.7% from the previous year. 
Managing inflation remains a key focus for policymakers. 
India's infrastructure sector is set for significant growth, with 
the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) planning $1.4 
trillion in investments by 2025. The growth estimate for FY25 
has been revised upwards to 7.2%. 
Despite the impact of global geopolitical events on demand, 
fuel prices, and foreign exchange, India has maintained 
its growth trajectory. A predicted rural recovery, aided by 
above-normal monsoons in 2024, is expected to further 
enhance growth.
(a)  Industry Structure and Development
 
Industry Overview

consumers in Zambia, one of its global markets. 
The campaign was well-received by the target audience 
and had high engagement. 
	
Sampling
 
Sampling has always been a crucial strategy for 
consumer acquisition. AHCL has upheld this practice 
for decades and continued it in FY24. The Company 
distributed samples of pain balms and roll-ons in 
high-traffic areas across Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, 
Telangana, 
Andhra 
Pradesh, 
Maharashtra, 
Delhi, 
Gujarat, and Kerala, engaging with and reaching out to

in FY24, increasing from ₹78.68 crore to ₹108.24 crore 
compared to the previous year. 
 
In FY24, the Women’s Hygiene category experienced 
significant growth. However, this led to a decrease in 
contribution from other categories despite their growth 
compared to the previous year. Sales of ₹38.32 crore 
in the Body category positioned it as the third largest 
segment in the OTC business.

Amrutanjan created a new TV commercial (TVC) that 
scientifically explains how dehydration affects cells and 
how Electro+ can help restore them to normal levels. 
The TVC features people from various walks of life, 
demonstrating the relevance of rehydration drinks for 
everyone, regardless of their profession. 
	
Digital Assets
 
The Company leveraged the IPL as a platform to reach 
a wider audience, utilizing digital and connected TV 
(CTV) channels.
 
AHCL engaged with influencers from various professions 
and launched video campaigns on digital platforms like 
YouTube and Instagram to communicate the benefits 
of healthy beverages like Electro+. These efforts were 
aimed at raising awareness and consideration for 
the brand. 
	
Visibility
 
AHCL enhanced visibility by consistently using point-of-
sale materials (POSM) nationwide. One particular 
initiative focused on promoting Maha Strong and 
showcasing its glass bottle packaging at the point of 
sale. The Company installed impactful displays in stores 
that are highly frequented by consumers. 
	
Rewards and Recognition
 
Amrutanjan was felicitated with the Economic Times 
(ET) ‘Best Healthcare Brands Award—2023.’ It is among

Electro+ ORS 
 
Global warming is resulting in higher temperatures and 
more frequent extreme weather events, making the 
issue of dehydration a more urgent concern than ever. 
The body loses water through sweat, especially when 
insufficient water intake leads to increased health risks. 
These climate changes and resulting water shortages 
have contributed to various health issues related 
to dehydration and heat stress. Risks have risen for 
conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, malnutrition, 
waterborne infectious diseases, chronic kidney disease, 
and symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, headaches, and 
even heatstroke. While consumers are becoming more 
aware of the need for rehydration, overall penetration in 
this category remains low.
 
Amrutanjan’s Electro+ is a highly effective rehydration 
drink specially formulated to address dehydration. 
It contains a perfect blend of electrolytes, glucose, 
and Vitamin C, providing half the recommended daily 
allowance in each 200-ml bottle. Moreover, Electro+ 
boasts the goodness of real fruit juice, which is available 
in delicious apple, orange, and lemon flavors.

AHCL acknowledges the importance of educating 
consumers about the need for rehydration. Therefore, all 
initiatives are solely focused on effectively delivering 
this message.

Quality, R&D and Safety 
 
Amrutanjan Health Care Limited (AHCL) prioritizes 
quality in all facets of its operations, guided by a 
steadfast 
commitment 
to 
quality 
management 
principles. The Company’s foremost objective is to 
ensure the well-being of its consumers by adhering to 
stringent regulatory standards and consistently meeting 
their expectations of safety, quality, and performance in 
all its products.
 
To accomplish this, AHCL has implemented standardized 
quality management systems at all its operational sites. 
These systems are designed to eliminate defects and 
enhance productivity, operating in alignment with Goods 
Manufacturing Practices outlined in the Indian Drugs 
& Cosmetics Act. The Company’s Quality Management 
System for the over-the-counter (OTC) division and 
the Food Safety Management System for the Food and 
Beverage (F&B) division are aligned with ISO standards, 
further underscoring its dedication to quality and safety. 
AHCL is committed to building quality and safety into 
its products at every stage of production. This entails 
rigorous evaluation and continual monitoring of the 
Company’s suppliers and materials, as well as a keen 
focus on delivering the highest quality output, to ensure 
consumer satisfaction.
 
AHCL’s Research & Development team follows a 
Quality by Design (QbD) approach to developing 
new products, consistently striving for excellence in 
quality. Its flagship products have been subjected 
to comprehensive clinical studies, validating their 
efficacy and safety. The packaging design is not only 
unique to Amrutanjan Health Care Limited, but also 
incorporates anti-counterfeiting features, for enhanced 
consumer protection.
 
To 
demonstrate 
the 
Company’s 
unwavering 
commitment to quality and food safety, its management 
systems undergo rigorous annual audits by TUV 
	
Purchase & Logistics
 
In FY24, the Company faced many challenges. 
The Red Sea issue, Suez Canal issue, and the ongoing 
Russia-Ukraine war impacted its material supply. 
However, AHCL was able to overcome these challenges 
through 
meticulous 
and 
close 
follow-up 
with 
the vendors.
 
Favorable crude oil prices and relatively stable forex, 
coupled with effective procurement strategies, resulted 
in a savings of ₹431 lakh from polymers and base 
material for the Company's pain balm. Although there 
was a marginal impact on sourcing a few raw materials 
in the beverage division, there were savings in sourcing 
OTC raw materials, particularly essential oils and 
Karpoor, with a net saving of ₹155 lakhs.
 
The Company launched new products like Dental 
Pain Gel, Pain cream and Electro Plus Lemon and 
Low-sugar variants.
 
After the implementation of SAP in the purchase to 
pay process, the Company began migrating towards 
automated process controls. All the purchases in 
the Company are processed through a centralized 
procurement process.

economies in the world for 2024; the country is on 
track to become the third-largest economy within 
the next three years. India’s growth is projected to 
be 7%1 this year, reflecting a carryover from upward 
revisions to growth in 2023. This projection has been 
attributed to strength in domestic demand and a rising 
working-age population2.
 
Indian FMCG sector witnessed a noteworthy 6% growth 
in value during Q4 FY233, and is poised for tremendous 
growth in FY24, according to a recent CRISIL Report4. 
The projected growth for the FMCG sector is 7-9%, 
fuelled by higher volume, revival in rural demand, steady 
urban demand5, and the decrease in consumption gaps 
between urban and rural markets6. FMCG companies are 
relying on a lower inflationary environment, projections

certification bodies, ensuring ongoing compliance with 
established standards.
 
Amrutanjan is a recognized brand and pioneer in 
the industry, with a seal of trust and credibility in its 
products, having catered to consumers’ pain-free living 
for over a century. It is now a valuable and popular brand 
among Indian consumers.
 
The 
Company’s 
OTC 
Manufacturing 
units 
boast 
ISO certification and are fully compliant with Good 
Manufacturing Practices and the regulations outlined in 
the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. AHCL holds itself to the 
highest standards of quality during the manufacturing 
process to ensure the production of effective and 
defect-free products. With a capacity of 1,700 MTe, the 
Company is well-equipped to meet market demands.
 
Furthermore, AHCL recently inaugurated a cutting-edge 
manufacturing facility for allopathic products, equipped 
with advanced manufacturing and testing equipment in 
compliance with cGMP regulations. Products outlined in 
the USFDA OTC Monograph Guidelines will be registered 
with the USFDA, enabling AHCL to export these products 
to the USA and other nations. 
 
The Company has obtained a permanent license for 
its new Allopathic division from the State Drug Control 
Department, for the manufacturing and sale of drugs. 
Currently, AHCL is manufacturing the OTC monograph 
products for process validation and stability studies.
 
In order to mitigate the production loss risk during 
unforeseen events like the recent pandemic, the 
Company 
has 
set 
up 
duplicate 
manufacturing 
facilities 
for 
key 
products 
across 
both 
plants. 
This contingency plan ensures uninterrupted supply to 
meet consumer demands in case one plant faces any 
operational challenges.
 
In the Beverage plant, the Company is producing 
ready-to-serve fruit juice and a variant with electrolytes. 
It  follows the best practices as per FSSAI. The plant has 
been upgraded with a new line and state-of-the-art 
manufacturing equipments, with double the production 
capacity. The plant has its own Quality Control and 
Microbiology Lab facilities. It complies with the statutory 
and regulatory requirements.
 
As a first step in taking eco-friendly initiatives, 
the Company has transitioned from using plastic 
containers to using glass bottles for one of its products. 
The Company has implemented an EPR system to 
ensure compliance with environmentally responsible 
waste management practices, thus reducing its impact 
on the ecosystem.
 
The AHCL management provides a safe working 
environment for all its employees. The Company also 
has in place, a Safety Committee, which conducts 
regular safety audits. AHCL’s employees are motivated 
to improve its operations through training and quality 
circle meetings for continual improvements.
 
Overall, the Company takes pride in moving towards 
digital 
transformation, 
adhering 
to 
high-quality 
manufacturing practices, expanding its international 
presence, and maintaining a safe and motivated 
workforce. The Company remains committed to further 
growth and excellence in the industry.
 
In the women’s hygiene category, the Company 
currently sources its Comfy Sanitary Napkin through a 
strategic partnership under a private label agreement, 
achieving a turnover of ₹100 crore in FY24. In response 
to increased demand, the Company will establish its 
own manufacturing facility, operational by Q2 of FY25. 
This state-of-the-art plant will feature advanced, 
high-speed, fully automated machinery and will have a 
production capacity of approximately 2.5 million pads 
per day, with plans for gradual ramp-up.
 
This strategic investment highlights the Company’s 
commitment to delivering consistent, high-quality 
products and positions it for sustainable growth in the 
competitive women’s hygiene category. The Company 
remains dedicated to innovation and excellence, 
ensuring products meet customers’ needs and positively 
impact the community.
	
Information Technology
 
Digital transformation is now the core of any business 
transformation, 
and 
at AHCL, the 
Company 
is 
passionate about adopting modern and efficient ways 
of doing business. The use of new-age tools with 
efficient automation and techniques has helped address 
operational issues and improve customer satisfaction. 
Confidentiality, integrity, and availability continue to be 
the foundation of Amrutanjan’s IT Policy. The Company 
is committed to securing and protecting customer 
interests and critical business data.
	
SAP 
 
SAP 
enterprise 
process 
adherence 
was 
a 
key 
focus area. The Company’s key functional teams in 
Manufacturing, Supply Chain & Logistics, Quality, and 
Financial Accounting were mandated to implement 
automated controls provided by SAP. Therefore, many 
of the manual processes were replaced with automated 
controls, and the Company witnessed the benefits 
of this endeavor in the overall business operations. 
SAP Bank Integration is one such automation that went 
live in FY24. The General IT Controls (GITC) guidelines 
provide standard operating procedures for some of the 
most important aspects for maintaining a reliable and 
full-proof system. Refined Segregation of Duties (SOD) 
ensured relevant user access control and authorization. 
Some fundamental business continuity aspects were 
also revisited using SAP, such as disaster recovery, 
backup & restoration, and maintaining audit trails. 
SAP users now have the flexibility to perform some of 
their regular business transactions remotely on their 
mobiles, using the SAP Fiori applications.
	
World of Amrutanjan (WOA) Stores 
 
AHCL’s World of Amrutanjan Stores are one-of-its-kind 
experience stores that invite consumers to try, buy

Chennai, are supported by modern infrastructure and 
applications for quick billing and payment transactions 
using any of the online payment modes for convenience. 
The WOA Stores are under CCTV surveillance for

Information Security 
 
Information Security is one of the most critical areas in 
the Company’s digital transformation journey, especially 
when its business operations require interactions with 
external entities, exposing the Company to risks and 
threats. To assess AHCL’s security posture, the Company

(h) Material 
Developments 
in 
Human 
Resources/
Industrial Relations Front, including the Number of 
People Employed
 
Human Capital
 
AHCL has always believed in ‘Building Brand and 
Building People’. Over the past year, the Company’s 
Human Resources function has been actively striving to 
evolve key initiatives to enhance employee engagement, 
streamline processes and align HR practices with the 
Company’s goals. The Company aims to enable people 
to perform better and simplify the processes for 
faster execution.
 
The Company continuously strives to attract the best 
talent and nurture in-house talent. One of the key 
objectives is to retain good performers by providing them 
with unique opportunities for career growth. This implies 
implementing best practices, opportunities for learning, 
of a normal monsoon, and a good rabi yield to support 
higher volume growth. Other key drivers for growth of 
the FMCG sector are government initiatives to stimulate 
consumption and create job opportunities, and digital 
transformation initiatives7. 
 
In the D2C segment, rapid digital transformation and 
evolving consumer purchase behavior underscored 
the industry’s adaptability and proactive approach to 
catering to digitally savvy consumers amidst changing 
market dynamics. In the retail sector, Modern Trade 
continues to exhibit strong performance with a high 
double-digit growth rate of 16.8%8, demonstrating 
resilience 
and 
sustained 
demand. 
This 
upward 
momentum in Modern Trade contributes positively to 
the overall market scenario. Non-Food categories have 
outpaced Food categories in consumption growth, 
achieving an increase of 8.7%. Additionally, the online 
sales channel for FMCG has grown significantly, reaching 
a valuation of ₹1.7 trillion9. 
 
Premiumization and volume growth are projected 
to expand operating margins by 50-75 basis points, 
reaching 20-21%10. However, increasing marketing 
expenses driven by intense competition will constrain 
further margin expansion. 
 
According to the CRISIL report, product realizations 
are expected to grow modestly with slight increases 
in key raw material prices for the food and beverages 
(F&B) segment. The softening of price growth has 
aided consumption, except for staples where non-oil 
categories continue to experience double-digit price 
growth. Prices for the personal care (PC) and home 
care (HC) segments are expected to remain stable.
 
Higher MSP, increased government spending on rural 
infrastructure, and a favorable monsoon will contribute 
to a rural consumer volume growth to the tune of 6-7% 
in FY25. Urban consumer volume growth is projected 
to remain steady at 7-8%, driven by rising disposable 
incomes and a focus on premium products. 
 
However, the FMCG sector’s outlook is not without its 
challenges. Inflationary pressures, subdued consumer 
confidence, and prevailing unemployment rates are 
expected to have an impact on the sector’s growth. 
Despite these challenges, the FMCG market in India 
remains resilient and is poised for significant growth. 
Key governmental initiatives such as Gati Shakti and 
Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 have been instrumental in 
fortifying the FMCG sector’s foundation and fostering 
long-term growth. The positive impact of the interim 
Union Budget 2024-25, with its focus on rural economic 
boosters, is expected to amplify this trend.
(e) Risk and Concern
 
A risk is a potential event or non-event, the occurrence 
or non-occurrence of which can adversely affect the 
objectives or strategy of the Company or result in 
opportunities being missed. Risk is measured in terms 
of likelihood of occurrence and potential impact if it 
materializes. COVID-19 remains a potential risk, with 
any new variant potentially leading to hospitalizations 
and lockdowns, causing hardship for the population and 
disrupting the progress of the economic resurgence.
 
The two greatest risks for the economy at this stage stem 
from inflationary pressures and supply-side concerns. 
 
The unpredictable fluctuation in key raw material prices, 
risk of new product launches not panning out, supply 
chain disruptions, and major changes in government 
policies & regulations are some of the long-term 
risks associated with the business. At Amrutanjan, 
risks are classified under preventive, strategic, and 
external categories.
 
Risk Management
 
Risk management is a structured, consistent, and 
continuous process across the organization for 
identifying, assessing, decision-making on responses 
to, and reporting on opportunities and threats that may 
affect the achievement of the Company’s objectives. 
Risk management does not aim to eliminate risks, as that 
would simultaneously eliminate all chances of rewards 
or opportunities. Instead, constant efforts are made to 
analyze their potential impact, assess the changes to 
the risk environment, and define actions to mitigate any 
adverse impacts.
 
Amrutanjan 
Health 
Care 
Limited 
(AHCL) 
has 
implemented a risk management framework that 
ensures timely identification, analysis, and assessment 
of risks and potential consequences, formulation of 
specific mitigation strategies, and their seamless 
execution. The framework recognizes that risks are 
highly interconnected and interdependent. This evolved 
approach views risks within a coordinated and strategic 
framework, integrated within the organization.
 
The Risk Management Committee, which is chaired by 
the Chairman & Managing Director and comprises of 
three Non-executive Directors, the CFO and the COO, 
monitors organization-wide risk management activities 
and reports bi-annually to the Board of Directors.
(f) Internal Control Systems and their Adequacy
 
The adequacy of the internal control systems and key 
processes are audited quarterly in selected areas by 
qualified external auditors, and are reported to the Audit 
Committee. The follow-up action is reverted on, with a 
timeline and status.
 
Statutory compliances are monitored through a fully 
automated compliance monitoring tool, and a quarterly 
compliance dashboard is presented to the Board. 
 
The Company has also established an in-house 
Internal Audit wing, reporting to the Chairman 
and 
Managing 
Director 
(CMD) 
for 
conducting 
audits, internal checks on processes, and providing 
suggestions for further improvements in the areas 
audited. This team coordinates with the Internal 
Auditors to ensure the successful closure of their audit 
observations. The Internal Auditors have a free right to 
access all required information. The Audit Committee 
functions independently, with complete access to the 
Internal Auditors and Statutory Auditors.
 
The Audit Committee continues to monitor the 
effectiveness of internal control over the use of new 
technologies that impact the financial controls and 
reporting the risk.

Relationship with Union

relations, and maintaining a healthy relationship with 
its affiliated Union – Amrutanjan Health Care Limited 
Employees’ Union. It enjoys a cordial relationship 
with the Union, and its representatives are taken into 
confidence on all Industrial Relations issues, ensuring 
that any conflict arising between the Union and the 
management are amicably sorted.

Independent Auditor’s Report (Continued)
Information Other than the Financial Statements and 
Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the annual report, but 
does not include the financial statements and auditor’s report 
thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available 
to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information identified above 
when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, 
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance 
and take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant 
laws and regulations.
Management’s and Board of Directors’/Board of 
Trustees’ Responsibilities for the Financial Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of 
the Act with respect to the preparation of these financial 
statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, 
profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, changes in 
equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, including 
the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under 
Section 133 of the Act. The respective Management and 
Board of Directors of the Company/Board of Trustees of the 
ESOP Trust are responsible for maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company/
ESOP Trust and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and  design,  implementation 
and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
the preparation and presentation of the financial statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Management and 
Board of Directors/Board of Trustees are responsible for 
assessing the Company’s/ESOP Trust’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Board of Directors/Board of Trustees 
either intends to liquidate the Company/ESOP Trust or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors/Board of Trustees are also responsible 
for overseeing the financial reporting process of the 
Company/ESOP Trust.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, 
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting 
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the Management and Board 
of Directors.
 
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparation of financial statements and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation.
 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial statements of ESOP Trust of the Company 
to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are 
Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of Amrutanjan Health Care Limited 
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Amrutanjan

profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), 
statement of changes in equity and statement of cash 
flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial 
statements, including material accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, and based on 
the consideration of financial statements and report of the 
auditor of the ESOP Trust the aforesaid financial statements 
give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 
(“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair 
view in conformity with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as 
at 31 March 2024, and its profit and other comprehensive 
income, changes in equity and its cash flows for the year 
ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 
Statements section of our report. We are independent of 
the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and 
the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements 
and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence 
obtained by us along with the consideration of report of 
auditor of the ESOP trust referred to in the ‘Other Matters’ 
section below is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion on the financial statements.
Key Audit Matter
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements of the current period. These matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Description of Key Audit Matter
Revenue recognition- See note 3(J) and 23 to the financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Company’s revenue is derived primarily from sale of 
goods. The principal products of the Company comprise pain 
management, congestion management, beverages and hygiene 
that are mainly sold through stockiest. Revenue from sale of 
goods is recognized on transfer of control of the products to 
the customer. The Company uses a variety of shipment terms 
across its operating markets and this has an impact on the 
timing of revenue recognition. The performance obligations in 
the contracts may be fulfilled at the time of dispatch, delivery 
or upon formal customer acceptance depending on contract 
terms. 
There is a risk that revenue could be recognized at a time 
which is different from transfer of control especially for sales 
transactions occurred on and around the reporting period. In 
view of this and since revenue is a key performance indicator 
of the Company, we have identified timing of the revenue 
recognition as a key audit matter
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the following 
audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence:
1.  
Assessed the appropriateness of the Company’s 
accounting policy for revenue recognition as per relevant 
accounting standard.
2.  
Obtained an understanding of the Company’s sales process 
and evaluated design and implementation of key internal 
controls in relation to the timing of revenue recognition. We 
also tested the operating effectiveness of such controls for 
a sample of transactions with special reference to controls 
over revenue recognized on and around the year end.
3.  
For a sample of sale transactions selected using statistical 
sampling, performed detailed testing and in particular 
examined whether these are recognised in the period in 
which control is transferred. This included examination of 
the terms and conditions of the customer orders including 
the shipping terms, transporter documents and customer 
acceptances, as applicable.
4. 
Performed analytical procedures on current year revenue 
based on trends and where appropriate, conducting further 
enquiries and tests to identify unusual transactions.
5. 
We also tested sample journal entries for revenue 
recognised during the year, selected based on specified 
risk-based criteria, to identify unusual transactions.

Trust included in the financial statements, which have 
been audited by auditor of the ESOP Trust, such auditor 
of the ESOP Trust remain responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audit carried out by 
them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 
Our responsibilities in this regard are further described in 
the section titled “Other Matters” in this audit report.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law 
or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because 
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of 
such communication.
Other Matter

included in the financial statements of the Company, whose 
financial statements reflects total assets (before accounting 
adjustments) of `168.57 lakhs as at March 31, 2024, total

`161.29 lakhs for the year ended on that date, as considered

ESOP Trust have been audited by the auditor of the ESOP

Amrutanjan Health Care Limited for the year ended 31 March 2024
(Referred to in paragraph 1 under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of 
even date)
(i)  (a)  (A)  The 
Company 
has 
maintained 
proper 
records showing full particulars, including 
quantitative details and situation of Property, 
Plant and Equipment.
  
 
(B) The Company has maintained proper records 
showing full particulars of intangible assets.
 
(b) According to the information and explanations 
given to us and on the basis of our examination 
of the records of the Company, the Company 
has a regular programme of physical verification 
of its Property, plant and equipment by which 
all Property, plant and equipment are verified in 
a phased manner over a period of three years. 
In accordance with this programme, certain 
property, plant and equipment were verified during 
the year. In our opinion, this periodicity of physical 
verification is reasonable having regard to the 
size of the Company and the nature of its assets. 
Discrepancies noticed on such verification were 
not material and have been properly dealt with in 
the books of account.
 
(c) According to the information and explanations 
given to us and on the basis of our examination 
of the records of the Company, the title deeds of 
immovable properties (other than immovable 
properties where the Company is the lessee and

of the lessee) disclosed in the financial statements 
are held in the name of the Company.
 
(d) According to the information and explanations 
given to us and on the basis of our examination

assets or both during the year.
 
(e) According to the information and explanations 
given to us and on the basis of our examination

Act, 1988 and rules made thereunder.
(ii) (a) The inventory, except goods-in-transit and stocks 
lying with third parties, has been physically verified 
by the management during the year. For stocks 
lying with third parties at the year-end, written 
confirmations have been obtained and for goods-in-
transit subsequent evidence of receipts has been 
linked with inventory records. In our opinion, the 
frequency of such verification, procedures and 
coverage as followed by management needs to 
be  strengthened. No discrepancies were noticed 
on verification between the physical stocks and 
the book records that were more than 10% in the 
aggregate of each class of inventory.
   
(b) According to the information and explanations 
given to us and on the basis of our examination 
of the records of the Company, the Company has 
not been sanctioned any working capital limits

is not applicable to the Company.
 
(iii) According to the information and explanations 
given to us and on the basis of our examination

not made any investments, provided guarantee or 
security or granted any loans or advances in the 
nature of loans, secured or unsecured, to companies, 
firms, limited liability partnerships or any other 
parties during the year. Accordingly, provisions of 
clauses 3(iii)(a) to 3(iii)(f) of the Order are not 
applicable to the Company.
 
(iv) According to the information and explanations 
given to us and on the basis of our examination of

applicable to the Company. Accordingly, clause 
3(iv) of the Order is not applicable.
 
(v) The Company has not accepted any deposits or 
amounts which are deemed to be deposits from 
the public. Accordingly, clause 3(v) of the Order is 
not applicable.
 
(vi) We have broadly reviewed the books of accounts 
maintained by the Company pursuant to the 
rules prescribed by the Central Government 
for maintenance of cost records under Section 
148(1) of the Act in respect of its products 
manufactured and are of the opinion that prima 
facie, the prescribed accounts and records have 
been made and maintained. However, we have not 
carried out a detailed examination of the records

accurate or complete.

the current and in the immediately preceding 
financial year.

as on the date of the audit report that the Company 
is not capable of meeting its liabilities existing at 
the date of balance sheet as and when they fall 
due within a period of one year from the balance 
sheet date. We, however, state that this is not an 
assurance as to the future viability of the Company. 
We further state that our reporting is based on the 
facts up to the date of the audit report and we 
neither give any guarantee nor any assurance that 
all liabilities falling due within a period of one year 
from the balance sheet date, will get discharged by 
the Company as and when they fall due.

our main audit report which explains that the other

us after the date of this auditor’s report.
 
(xx) In our opinion and according to the information 
and explanations given to us, there is no 
unspent amount under sub-section (5) of 
Section 135 of the Act pursuant to any project. 
Accordingly, clauses 3(xx)(a) and 3(xx)(b) of

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the financial statements of 
Amrutanjan Health Care Limited for the year ended 31 March 2024
Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-
section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(h) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of 
even date)
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements of Amrutanjan Health Care Limited 
(“the Company”) as of 31 March 2024 in conjunction with 
our audit of the financial statements of the Company for the 
year ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements and such internal financial controls 
were operating effectively as at 31 March 2024, based on 
the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements criteria established by the Company considering 
the essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities 
for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors 
are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial controls based on the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements criteria established by the 
Company considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of 
its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the 
safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of 
frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on 
Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to 
the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements were 
established and maintained and if such controls operated 
effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference 
to Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements include those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management override 
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud 
may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk 
that the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.

ii) 
Classification and subsequent measurement 
	
Financial assets:
 
On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at
 
- 
amortised cost;
 
- 
fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
 
- 
fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)
 
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except if and in the period the Company 
changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on 
the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model. 
 
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as 
at FVTPL:
 
a)  the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
 
b)  the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. 
 
A debt investment is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it meets both the following conditions 
and is not designated as FVTPL:
 
a)  the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling financial assets; and 
 
 
 
b)  the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. 
 
On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Company may irrevocably elect to present 
subsequent changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI (designated as FVOCI – equity investment). This election is 
made on an investment by investment basis. 
 
All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. 
On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements 
to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting 
mismatch that would otherwise arise.
 
Financial assets: Business model assessment
 
The Company makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio 
level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and the information is provided to management. 
The information considered includes:
 
-  
the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice; 
 
 
 
-  
these include whether management strategy focuses on earning contractual interest, maintaining a particular 
interest rate profile, matching the duration of financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected 
cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of assets;  
 
 
-  
how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Company’s management; 
 
 
-  
the risk that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held with in the business model) 
and how those risks are managed;  
 
 
-  
how managers of the business are compensated;  
 
 
-  
the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior period, the reasons for such sales and 
expectations about future sales activity.
 
Financial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on fair value basis are 
measured at FVTPL.
 
Financial assets: Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest
 
For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 
‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal 
amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs, as well as a profit margin.
 
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Company considers 
the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term 
 
Note 33 – fair valuation of financial assets; and 
 
 
 
Note 34 – measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities 
E.   Measurement of fair values  
 
A number of the Company’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial 
and non-financial assets and liabilities. 
 
The Company has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The Chief Financial 
Officer has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value measurements.
 
The Chief Financial Officer regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party 
information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the Chief Financial Officer 
assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the 
requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified.
 
Significant valuation issues are reported to the Company’s audit committee.
 
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation 
techniques as follows: 
 
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. 
as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
 
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
 
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company uses observable market data as far as possible. If the 
inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the 
fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input 
that is significant to the entire measurement. 
 
The Company recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during 
which the change has occurred.
 
Further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in note 33 – financial instruments 
and note 31- Employee stock compensation

Material accounting policies 
A. 
Operating cycle 
 
 
Based on the nature of products and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in 
cash and cash equivalent, the Company has considered 12 months as the operating cycle .
B. 
Foreign currency transactions 
 
 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Company at their functional currency spot rates at the date 
of the transaction. 
 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the 
exchange rate at the reporting date. Exchange differences that arise on settlement of monetary items or on reporting at 
each balance sheet date are recognised as income or expenses in the period in which they arise. Non-monetary items 
which are carried at historical cost denominated in a foreign currency are reported using the exchange rates at the date 
of transaction.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency exchange differences are generally 
recognised in profit or loss.
C. 
Financial instruments  
 
i) 
Recognition and initial measurement  
 
 
Trade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are 
initially recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
 
A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially 
measured at fair value plus or minus, for an item not at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially 
measured at the transaction price.

D. 
Property, plant and equipment 
 
i) 
Recognition and initial measurement 
 
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment including capital work-in-progress shall be recognised as an asset 
if, and only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost 
of the item can be measured reliably. Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, (which includes 
capitalised borrowing costs, if any) less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
 
Cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable 
purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable cost of bringing the item to its 
working condition for its intended use. 
 
The cost of a self-constructed item of property, plant and equipment comprises the cost of materials and direct labour, 
any other costs directly attributable to bringing the item to working condition for its intended use.
 
If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as 
separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
 
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in statement of profit and loss.
ii) 
Subsequent expenditure 
 
 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the 
expenditure will flow to the Company.
iii) Transition to Ind AS 
 
The cost property, plant and equipment at 1 April 2016, the Company’s date of transition to Ind AS, was determined with 
reference to its carrying value recognized as per the previous GAAP (deemed cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS.
iv) Depreciation
 
Depreciation is calculated on cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values over their 
estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Freehold land 
is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment for the current and comparative 
periods (in years) are as follows:
Asset category
Management estimate of useful life
Useful life as per Schedule II
Buildings including roads
3/ 10 / 30
30
Plant and equipment
15

Moulds (Included under plant and equipment)

Computers and servers
3 / 6
3 / 6
Furniture and fittings including Lab equipments
5 / 10
5 / 10
Motor vehicles
8 / 10
8 / 10
 
Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the asset or the lease period 
whichever is lower. 
 
Depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted prospectively, 
if appropriate. Based on technical evaluation and consequent advice, the management believes that its estimates of 
useful lives as given above best represent the period over which management expects to use these assets. 
 
Depreciation on additions (disposals) is provided on a pro-rata basis i.e. from (up to) the date on which asset is ready 
for use (disposed of).
E. 
Intangible assets  
i) 
Intangible assets  
 
 
Intangible assets (including those acquired by the Company in a business combination, if any) are initially measured at 
cost. Such intangible assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated 
impairment losses. 
ii) 
Subsequent expenditure 
 
 
 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset 
to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised 
in statement of profit and loss as incurred.
that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making 
this assessment, the Company considers: 
 
 
 
-  
contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;  
 
 
-  
terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable interest rate features; 
 
 
 
-  
prepayment and extension features; and 
 
 
 
-  
terms that limit the Company’s claim to cash flows from specified assets 
 
A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount 
substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include 
reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at 
a significant discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature that pertains or requires prepayment at an 
amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which 
may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if 
the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition. 
 
Financial assets: Subsequent measurement and gains and losses
Financial assets at 
FVTPL
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or 
dividend income, are recognised in statement of profit and loss.
Financial assets at 
amortised cost
These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The 
amortised cost is reduced by the impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses 
and impairment are recognised in statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is 
recognised in statement of profit and loss.
Equity investments 
at FVOCI
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss 
unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and 
losses are recognised in OCI and are not reclassified to statement of profit and loss.
	
Financial liabilities: Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses
 
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it 
is classified as held for trading, or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured 
at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial 
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign 
exchange gains and losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also 
recognised in statement of profit and loss.
iii) Derecognition 
	
Financial assets:
 
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset 
expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks 
and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Company neither transfers nor retains 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control of the financial asset. 
 
 
 
If the Company enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its balance sheet, but retains either all 
or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets are not derecognised. 
	
Financial liabilities:	
 
The Company derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired.’
 
The Company also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows under the modified 
terms are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair 
value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability with 
modified terms is recognised in profit or loss. 
iv) Offsetting 
 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only 
when, the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on 
a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

12-month expected credit losses are the portion of expected credit losses that result from default events that are 
possible within 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 
12 months). 
 
 
In all cases, the maximum period considered when estimating expected credit losses is the maximum contractual period 
over which the Company is exposed to credit risk.  
 
 
When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when 
estimating expected credit losses, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and 
available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on 
the Company’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward looking information.
 
The Company assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 90 days 
past due.
 
The Company considers a financial asset to be in default when:
 
- 
the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Company in full, without recourse by the Company to 
actions such as realising security (if any is held); or
 
- 
the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.
ii) 
Measurement of expected credit losses 
 
 
 
Expected credit losses are a probability weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present 
value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the Company in accordance with the contract 
and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive).
	
Presentation of allowance for expected credit losses in the balance sheet	 	
	
 
Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of 
the assets.
	
Write-off
 
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no 
realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Company determines that the debtor does not have 
assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write off. 
However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the 
Company’s procedures for recovery of amounts due. 
 
 
iii) Impairment of non-financial assets
 
At each reporting date, the Company reviews its non-financial assets(other than inventories, contract assets, and 
deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the 
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
 
For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from 
continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”). 
 
The recoverable amount of an individual asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of 
disposal. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset 
or CGU.
 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
 
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.
 
In respect of other assets for which impairment loss has been recognised in prior periods, the Company reviews at each 
reporting date whether there is any indication that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is 
reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Such a reversal is 
made only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
H. 
Employee benefits  
 
i) 
Short-term employee benefits 
 
 
 
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months 
after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognised in respect of employees’ 
services up to the end of the reporting and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are 
settled. The liabilities are presented as current employee benefit obligations in the balance sheet. 
 
 
iii) Transition to Ind AS 
 
 
 
The cost Intangible assets at 1 April 2016, the Company’s date of transition to Ind AS, was determined with reference to 
its carrying value recognised as per the previous GAAP (deemed cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS. 
iv) Amortisation  
 
 
Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of intangible assets less their estimated residual values over their 
estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, and is included in depreciation and amortisation in Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
 
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets for the current and comparative periods (in years) are as follows:
Asset category
Management estimate of useful life
Computer software
3 - 10
 
Amortisation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each financial year and adjusted 
if appropriate.
v) 
Intangible assets under development  
 
 
Intangible assets under development includes intangible assets which are in process of being ready for its intended use 
and it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and 
the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.  
 
 
F. 
Inventories 
 
 
 
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted 
average cost basis and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and 
other costs incurred in bringing them to their present location and condition. Costs incurred in bringing each product to 
its present location and condition are accounted for as follows: 
 
Raw materials and packing materials: Cost includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories 
to their present location and condition. Cost is determined on weighted average cost basis.
 
Finished goods: Cost includes cost of direct materials and labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on 
the actual operating capacity for variable overheads and normal capacity for fixed overheads. 
 
Traded goods: Cost includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location 
and condition. Cost is determined on weighted average basis. 
 
 
 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion 
and selling expenses. The net realisable value of work-in-progress is determined with reference to the selling prices 
of related finished products.  Raw materials, components and other supplies held for use in the production of finished 
products are not written down below cost except in cases where the material prices have declined and it is estimated that 
the cost of the finished products will exceed their net realisable value. The comparison of cost and net realisable value is 
made on an item-by-item basis. 
G. 
Impairment 
 
 
i) 
Impairment of trade receivables and financial assets  
 
 
The Company recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost.
 
At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit impaired. 
A financial asset is ‘credit impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash 
flows of the financial asset have occurred.
 
Evidence that a financial asset is credit impaired includes the following observable data:
 
-  
significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
 
-  
a breach of contract such as a default or past dues;
 
-  
the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise;
 
-  
it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
 
-  
the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.”  
 
 
Loss allowances for trade receivables are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses.
 
Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the 
expected life of a financial instrument.

I. 
Provisions (other than for employee benefits)  
 
 
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that 
can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows (representing the best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date) at a pre-tax rate that reflects current 
market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is 
recognised as finance cost. Expected future operating losses are not provided for. 
 
 
J. 
Revenue  
 
 
The Company earns revenue from sale of products in pain management, congestion management, beverages & hygiene. 
The Company also earns revenue from sale of services in pain management.  
 
 
 
Disaggregation of revenue 
 
 
 
The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by the nature of sale i.e. manufactured and traded 
goods and based on the reporting segments based on the information reviewed by the CODM. The Company believes that 
this disaggregation is the best description on how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our  revenues and cash 
flows are affected by industry, market and other economic factors. Also refer note 23. 
 
 
Variable consideration  
 
 
If the consideration in a contract includes the variable amount, the Company estimates the amount of consideration to 
which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated 
at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of 
cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is 
subsequently resolved.
	
Stockist incentives, claims and schemes
 
Arrangements with customers includes a provision for stockist incentives, discount schemes and claims. In those 
instances, where there is a valid expectation from the customers to receive a incentive / discount / recover claims, the 
amount of variable consideration which is included in the transaction price may be constrained, unless included in the 
net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue 
recognised under the arrangement will not occur in a future period. The Company applies the most likely amount method 
for determining the stockist incentives, discount schemes and claims.  
 
 
 
Contract balances  
 
	
Contract assets	
	
	
 
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the 
Company performs by transferring goods or services to a customer, before the customer pays consideration or before 
payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional.  
 
	
Trade receivables	
	
 
 
A receivable represents the Company’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e. only the passage of 
time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets - note 3C - 
financial instruments - initial recognition and subsequent measurement.  
 
 
 
Contract liabilities	 	
 
 
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received 
consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the 
Company transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the 
payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Company performs under 
the contract. 
 
Performance obligations and revenue recognition policies 
 
 
 
Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects 
the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. 
 
 
The following details provides information about the nature and timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations in 
contracts with customers, including significant payment terms, and the related revenue recognition policies.
ii) 
Defined contribution plans  
 
 
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a 
separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. The Company makes specified 
monthly contributions towards Government administered provident fund scheme. Obligations for contributions to defined 
contribution plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in statement of profit and loss in the periods during 
which the related services are rendered by employees.  
 
iii) Defined benefit plans 
 
 
 
A defined benefits plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Company’s net 
obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future 
benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair 
value of any plan assets. 
 
The calculation of defined benefit obligation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit 
method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Company, the recognised asset is limited to the present 
value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions 
to the plan (‘the asset ceiling’). In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any 
minimum funding requirements.
 
Remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets 
(excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised in OCI. The Company 
determines the net interest expense / (income) on the net defined benefit liability / (asset) for the period by applying 
the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net 
defined benefit liability / (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability / (asset) during 
the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined 
benefit plans are recognised in statement of profit and loss.  
 
 
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to 
past service (‘past service cost’ or ‘past service gain’) or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in 
statement of profit and loss. The Company recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when 
the settlement occurs.
	
Gratuity
 
The Company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan (the “gratuity plan”) covering eligible employees. 
The plan provides payment to vested employees at retirement, death or termination of employment, of an amount based 
on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of employment with the Company. The Company provides the gratuity 
benefit through annual contribution to a fund managed by the Life Insurance corporation of India (‘LIC”) and  PNB 
MetLife India Insurance Co Ltd. Under this scheme the settlement obligation remains with the Company although the LIC 
administers the scheme and determines the contribution premium required to be paid by the Company. Liabilities related 
to the gratuity plan are determined and accrued by actuarial valuation using projected unit credit method by an 
independent actuary as at the balance sheet. 
 
 
iv) Other long-term employee benefits - compensated absences 
 
 
 
Accumulated absences expected to be carried forward beyond twelve months is treated as long-term employee benefit 
for measurement purposes. The Company’s net obligation in respect of other long-term employee benefit of accumulating 
compensated absences is the amount of future benefit that employees have accumulated at the end of the year. 
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value The obligation is measured annually by a qualified actuary using 
the projected unit credit method. Remeasurements are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. 
 
The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the Company does not have an unconditional 
right to defer the settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date.  
 
v) 
Share-based compensation  
 
 
The grant date fair value of equity settled share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an 
employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become 
entitled to the awards. The amount recognised as expense is based on the estimate of the number of awards for which the 
related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised 
as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market vesting conditions at 
the vesting date. 
vi) Treasury shares 
 
 
 
The Company has created a Trust, Amrutanjan Health Care Limited ESOP trust (herein after known as “ESOP Trust”), for 
administration of share-based payment to its employees. Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) 
are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. When the treasury shares are issued to the employees by the trust, the 
amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resultant gain / (loss) is transferred to / from reserves.

amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and 
 
 
 
the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an 
optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early 
termination of a lease unless the Company is reasonably certain not to terminate early. 
 
 
 
The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a 
change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Company’s estimate of 
the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Company changes its assessment of whether 
it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.
 
The Company presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in ‘property, plant and 
equipment’ and lease liabilities separately in the balance sheet within ‘Financial Liabilities’. 
 
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been 
classified as financing cash flows.
L. 
Recognition of interest income or expense  
 
 
Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method. 
 
 
 
The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the 
expected life of the financial instrument to: 
 
- 
the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or
 
- 
the amortised cost of the financial liability.” 
 
 
 
In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset 
(when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability.   
 
 
However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is 
calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer 
credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis. 
 
 
M. 
Income tax
 
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that 
it relates to a business combination or to an item recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
i) 
Current tax 
 
 
 
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment 
to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of 
the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes.  It is 
measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
 
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable  right to set off the recognised 
amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously. 
 
 
ii) 
Deferred tax  
 
 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and the corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes.   
 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future taxable profits 
are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of taxable temporary 
differences is insufficient to recognise a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits, adjusted for reversals of 
existing temporary differences, are considered. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when 
the probability of future taxable profits improves. 
 
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability 
is settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.  
 
 
The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company 
expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. 
 
 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and 
assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax 
entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be 
realised simultaneously.
i)	
Sale of goods and services	
	
	
 
Nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms
 
Revenue from sale of goods is recognized when control of the products being sold is transferred to our customer and 
when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations, depending on individual terms. The performance obligations in our 
contracts are fulfilled at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance depending on customer 
terms. Revenue towards satisfaction of performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction price (net of 
variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. The transaction price of the goods sold and services 
rendered is net of variable consideration on account of  stockist incentives, discount schemes and claims offered by 
the Company as part of the contract and any taxes or duties collected on behalf of the Government such as goods and 
services tax, etc. Accumulated experience is used to estimate provision for stockist incentives, discount schemes and 
claims. Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal will not occur. Invoice are usually 
payable within the mutually agreed credit period depending on individual customer terms.
 
Revenue from services is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered.
ii)	
Export incentives
 
Export incentives are recognized when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in 
respect of the exports made and when there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant 
export proceeds.
 
Determination of transaction price and allocation to performance obligation
 
Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for stockist incentives, 
discount schemes and claims if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes taxes collected 
from customers.
 
Refer note 23 for reconciliation of revenue recognised with contracted price.
K. 
Leases
 
The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if 
the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. 
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: 
(1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits 
from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.
 
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding 
lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less 
(short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease 
payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  
 
 
Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. 
ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.  
 
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted 
for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease 
incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease 
term and useful life of the underlying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, the recoverable amount(i.e. The higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use)is determined 
on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cashflows that are largely independent of those from 
other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit(CGU) to which the 
asset belongs.
 
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease 
payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental 
borrowing rates in the country of domicile of the leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment 
to the related right of use asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a 
termination option.
 
The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing 
sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.
 
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:  
 
 
fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
 
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the 
commencement date;

N. 
Operating segment 
 
 
 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (CODM) of the Company. The CODM is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of 
the operating segments of the Company. For the disclosure on reportable segments see note 37. 
 
 
O. 
Cash and cash equivalents  
 
 
Cash and Cash equivalents for the purpose of Cash Flow Statement comprise cash and cheques in hand, bank 
balances, demand deposits with banks where the original maturity is three months or less and other short term highly 
liquid investments.
P. 
Earnings per share  
 
	
Basic Earnings Per Share	
	
	
 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit (or loss) attributable to the owners of the Company by the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. The weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year is adjusted for bonus issue, bonus element in a rights issue to existing shareholders, share 
split and reverse share split (consolidation of shares). 
	
Diluted Earnings Per Share	
	
	
 
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit (considered in determination of basic earnings per share) 
after considering the effect of interest and other financing costs or income (net of attributable taxes) associated with 
dilutive potential equity shares by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings 
per share adjusted for the weighted average number of equity shares that would have been issued upon conversion of all 
dilutive potential equity shares. 
 
 
Q. 
Current/ Non-current classification 
 
 
 
The Company classifies an asset as current asset when: 
 
 
 
- 
it expects to realise the asset, or intends to sell or consume it, in its normal operating cycle; 
 
 
 
- 
it holds the asset primarily for the purpose of trading;  
 
 
- 
it expects to realise the asset within twelve months after the reporting period; or 
 
 
- 
the asset is cash or a cash equivalent unless the asset is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability 
for at least twelve months after the reporting period. 
 
 
 
All other assets are classified as non-current. 
 
 
A liability is classified as current when:  
 
 
- 
it expects to realise the asset, or intends to sell or consume it, in its normal operating cycle; 
 
 
 
- 
it holds the liability primarily for the purpose of trading;  
 
 
- 
the liability is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or 
 
 
 
- 
it does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue 
of equity instruments do not affect its classification. 
 
 
 
All other liabilities are classified as non-current. 
 
 
R. 
Contingent liability 
 
 
 
Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity or 
a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot 
be measured with sufficient reliability. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence 
in the financial statements. 
 
 
S. 
Recent pronouncements 
 
 
 
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards under Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. For the year ended 31 March 2024, MCA has not 
notified any new standards or amendments to the existing standards applicable to the Company.

The Company operates the following post-employment defined benefit plans.
 
The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan in India, governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The plan entitles 
an employee, who has rendered at least five years of continuous service, to gratuity at the rate of fifteen days wages for 
every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months, based on the rate of wages last drawn by the 
employee concerned. These defined benefit plans expose the Company to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest 
rate risk and market (investment) risk. The plan is managed through “Amrutanjan Health Care Limited Employees Gratuity 
Fund”. The funds maintained by “Amrutanjan Health Care Limited Employees Gratuity Fund” represent plan assets for 
the Company.
 
A. Funding
 
The plan is fully funded by the Company. The funding requirements are based on the gratuity fund’s actuarial measurement 
framework set out in the funding policies of the plan. The funding of plan is based on a separate actuarial valuation for 
funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from the assumptions set out in (E). Employees do not contribute 
to the plan. The Company expects to pay `164.60 to defined benefit plan in 2024-25.
 
B. Reconciliation of the net defined benefit liability

C. Financial risk management 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company's business activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks, namely credit risk, liquidity risk and market 
risk. The Company's management has the overall responsibility for establishing and governing the Company's risk 
management framework. The Company's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks 
faced by the Company, to set and monitor appropriate risk limits and controls, periodically review the changes in market 
conditions and reflect the changes in the policy accordingly. The key risks and mitigating actions are also placed before 
the audit committee of the Company.
 
i. Credit risk 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet 
its contractual obligations, and arises principally from Company's trade receivables and other financial assets. 
 
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure which is as follows:

 19,791.13 
	
Investments	 	
	
	
	
	
	
 
The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by investing in debt securities and minimum investment being made in equity 
instruments. The credit worthiness of the counterparties of the investments made are evaluated by the management on 
an ongoing basis and is considered to be good with low credit risk.
	
Trade receivables	 	
	
	
	
	
	
 
The Company has developed guidelines for the management of credit risk from trade receivables. The Company’s 
exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the 
customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on 
credit risk assessment. 
 
Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and  monitoring the creditworthiness of 
customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an 
allowance for doubtful debts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of the Company’s trade receivables.
 
Exposures to customers outstanding at the end of each reporting period are reviewed by the Company to determine 
incurred and expected credit losses.

The Company has not disclosed fair values of financial instruments such as trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, 
bank balances other than cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets, trade payables, lease liabilities and other 
financial liabilities, since their carrying amounts are reasonable approximates of fair values. 
 
B. Measurement of fair values 
 
 
 
 
 
Fair value hierarchy 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Level I - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 
Level II - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level I that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e.derived from prices).
 
Level III - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
 
The following table shows the levels in the fair value hierarchy as at each period:

iii. Market risks 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings or fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the 
price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, 
foreign exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable 
to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables. The Company is 
exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk (currency risk). 
	
Sensitivity analysis	
	
	
	
	
	
 
Equity price risk All of the Company’s listed equity investments are listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). For such 
investments classified as at FVTPL, the impact of a 2% increase in the market price of the shares at the reporting date on 
profit or loss would have been an increase of `0.09 after tax (31 March 2023: `0.04 after tax). An equal change in the 
opposite direction would have decreased profit or loss by `0.09 after tax (31 March 2023: `0.04 after tax).
	
Currency risk	 	
	
	
	
	
	
 
The Company is exposed to currency risk to the extent that there is mismatch between the currencies in which sales, 
purchase are denominated and the respective functional currencies of Company. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Foreign currency risk arise in transactions mainly from export of OTC products and import of raw materials and packing 
materials that gives rise to exchange rate fluctuation risk.

A reasonably possible (strengthening) / weakening of the ` against currencies would have affected  the measurement 
of financial instruments  denominated  in  a foreign  currency and  affected  profit or loss by the amounts shown below.

Other financial assets	
	
	
	
	
	
	
 
Other financial assets comprises of deposits with bank and financial institutions and interest accrued on such deposits 
These deposits are held with credit worthy banks and financial institutions. The credit worthiness of such banks and 
financial institutions are evaluated by the management on an ongoing basis and is considered to be good with low 
credit risk.
 
Other financial assets also comprise of export benefits receivable and rental deposits given to lessors and Electricity 
deposit given to Electricity Board. The Company is confident of collection the amounts and is considered to good with low 
credit risk. The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counter parties.
 
ii. Liquidity risks 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company  will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its 
financial liabilities. The Company approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet 
its liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable losses. In doing this, management considers both normal and 
stressed conditions.
 
Cash flow from operating activities provides the funds to service and finance the financial liabilities on a day-to-day basis.
 
The Company regularly monitors the rolling forecasts to ensure that it has sufficient cash on an on-going basis to meet 
operational needs. Any short term surplus cash generated, over and above the amount required for working capital 
management and other operational requirements, is retained as cash and cash equivalents (to the extent required) and 
any excess is invested in interest bearing term deposits and other highly marketable debt investments with appropriate 
maturities to optimise the cash returns on investments while ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities.
 
The following table shows the maturity analysis of the Company’s financial liabilities based on contractually agreed 
undiscounted cash flows along with its carrying value as at the balance sheet date.

(i)  Pending resolution of the respective proceedings, it is not practicable for the Company to estimate the timings of 
cash outflows, if any, in respect of the above as it is determinable only on receipt of judgements/decisions pending 
with various forums/authorities. The Company has reviewed all its pending litigations and proceedings and has 
adequately provided for where provisions are required and disclosed as contingent liabilities where applicable, in its 
financial statements. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a materially adverse 
effect on its financial position.
 
(ii)  Lease rent in respect of lease hold land has been revised by Government of Tamil Nadu with retrospective effect from 
November, 2001. The Company has contested the said revision before the Madras High court in writ petition.
 
(iii) During the earlier year, the Company had paid an amount of `11 to the Commissioner, Panchayat Union Thiruporur 
and during the prior years, the Company had paid an amount of `14.6 to Mamalapuram Urban Housing as contribution 
towards Tamil Nadu State Shelter Fund and an amount of `19.60 towards obtaining DTCP (Department of Town and 
Country Planning) approval for one of its Factories located in Alathur, Chennai, based on demand from the department. 
With respect to the above, the amounts payable towards property tax and other fees, are yet to be ascertained by the 
relevant authorities and the final assessment order is yet to be received by the Company. The Company could not 
ascertain reasonably the further amount payable and hence has been disclosed as contingent liability.
 
(iv)  In light of recent judgment of Honourable Supreme Court dated 28 February 2019 on the definition of “Basic Wages” 
under the Employees Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1952, there are significant uncertainties in 
determining the liability including, period of assessment, application of present and past employees and assessment 
of interest and penalties. Considering these interpretive challenges, the amount of the obligation could not be 
measured with sufficient reliability for past periods and hence disclosed as a contingent liability.
34 Leases  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(See accounting policy in Note 3(K))  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company leases office buildings. The leases typically run for a period between 3 to 9 years, with an option to renew 
the lease after that date. The Company leases certain office buildings with contract term less than one year. These leases 
are short term and / or leases of low value items. The Company has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease 
liabilities for these leases.
 
Information about leases for which the company is a lessee is presented below.

a)  The Company has not presented ratios relating to debt equity ratio and  debt service coverage ratio since the 
Company has not availed long term debt facilities in the current period and the preceding comparative period.

39 During the month of December 2022, the Company had received an anonymous whistle blower complaint alleging lapses 
by certain senior management employees including undue enrichment through marketing, advertising and procurement 
activities, ethical concerns, and conflict of interest etc. In this regard, the Company had initiated an independent forensic 
audit by external agencies on these alleged lapses. The draft investigation report of forensic audit dated 22 May 2023 has 
reported potential collusions with respect to marketing and advertising activities of the Company by certain employees, 
resulting into payments of potential kickbacks / commission aggregating to `8.65 to such employees from vendors 
onboarded during the previous financial year. The Company has terminated the services of those employees and vendors. 
There were no adverse findings with respect to activities related to procurement of raw materials, packing materials and 
logistics. The investigation in respect of contract / casual labour expenses were pending as at 31 March 2023. During the 
current year, the Company has completed the investigations and the final investigation reports dated 28 July 2023 
and 01 August 2023 has reported potential irregularities of `7.66 with respect to contract / casual labour payments. 
The management believes that the impact of aforesaid matters are not material to the financial statements.
