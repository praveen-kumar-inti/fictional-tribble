1.
GHG Emissions Risk
Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions is a vital component of a larger
sustainability plan to mitigate the impact
of climate change.
Steadily increasing revenues of the Foods
business driven by Volume Growth means
that manufacturing capacities will be
continually expanded with resultant
impact on GHG emissions.
We have started the
process of measuring GHG
emissions and in the process
of implementing ways to
enable reduction. We are in
the process of evaluating
new 
ways 
and
technologies available to
address GHG emissions.
Negative –
•
to set up improved and
efficient 
systems 
and
processes to reduce GHG
Emissions.
•
Increased Operational
costs in the short term.
•
Regulatory Implications
2.
Waste
Opportunity
Management
Waste management infrastructure has an
important role in delivering sustainable
development.
Sundrop Brands has a robust collection and
recycling process already in place with an
intent to reduce plastic consumption.
We also practice collection and disposal
of waste edible oil and food in a safe
manner.
Plastic waste is being
disposed of through PCB
approved recycling vendor.
We monitor all waste in our
manufacturing units and the
waste is within permissible
limits as laid down by the
regulators.
Positive –
•
The plastic waste
generated is collected
back and recycled safely.
•
Sundrop 
Brands’s
efforts 
are 
directed
towards 
low 
waste
generation 
in 
the
operations.
3.
Water
Risk
Management
Being a Food Company, Sundrop Brands
uses agricultural products as raw material
in most of its finished products. The
production of corn, peanuts, sunflower
seeds etc. is a water-intensive process.
Water being a finite resource, this poses
a risk to the operations of our business.
We are supporting various
initiatives towards water
management & harvesting.
Rainwater harvesting is being
practiced 
at 
all
manufacturing locations.
We are also practicing
reduction in raw water usage
in manufacturing.
Neutral-
•
We are putting
efforts 
to 
ensure
efficient 
water
management at our
plants.
•
No 
financial
implication is foreseen
in the nea rfuture.
4.
Energy
Opportunity
Management
Energy management reduces costs while
reducing the risk of energy scarcity.
Effective energy management reduces
the GHGs emissions and protects the
environment.
We measure the facility’s
current 
energy
consumption and identify
opportunities to decrease
energy consumption.
Processes and Systems are
in 
place 
to 
ensure
maximum 
energy
efficiency, and this will be
continuously improved.
Sundrop Brands’s Energy
efficiency initiatives include
implementation of energy
efficient lighting fixtures,
retrofitting high efficiency
motors and installation of
variable frequency drives at
all manufacturing units. We
are 
also 
evaluating
renewable sources of
energy on an ongoing
basis.
Positive –
•
Any cost put for
improving the energy
management system
will fetch positive
outcomes 
and
reduced cost in the
long run.
•
It will bring down
GHG emissions.

Employees
Risk
Health &
Safety
Health and safety (H&S) impact
Company’s practice as a responsible
organization. Effective H&S performance
also assists in attracting and retaining
quality talent.
This can also lead to decreased
Productivity.
We have effective health
and safety practices
deployed in accordance
with our policies on
health and safety.
Several efforts and
initiatives have been put
in place to ensure
employees’ health and
safety.
Neutral –
Any cost put towards
Employees’ health and
safety will yield positive
results in the long term.
6.
Human Rights
Risk
Changing regulations
around human rights pose a challenge.
We have all the relevant
policies to mitigate the
challenges of human
rights and track any
issues related to child
labour, forced labour,
involuntary labour &
sexual harassment.
We 
also 
maintain
harmonious working
environment with the
workers at our factories
and 
address 
their
concerns 
through
interactions   and
discussions.
Negative –
Any violation can lead
to severe reputational
risk and financial risk for
the organization due to
any punitive actions by
the regulators/ legal
authority.
7.
Labour
Risk
Practices
Changing regulations around labour
practices pose as a challenge
We 
have 
put 
in
substantial efforts to
ensure that we comply
with all the requirements
of labour law and do
beyond it as well.
Negative – Workplace
incidents related to
employee’s health and
safety can result in
litigation and plant
shutdown, 
impact
reputation and attract
fines from the regulator.
8.
Climate
Risk
Change
Disposable plastic in packaging of FMCG
products is a major contributor to green-
house gas emissions and this component
needs monitoring, control and reduction.
Climate Change can have an adverse
impact on our business in the long run.
We have initiated a well-
documented process
and 
executed
agreement with the
certified Vendor(s) to
ensure compliance with
the Extended Producer
Responsibility 
(EPR)
defined 
under 
the
Plastic 
Waste
Management Rules to
ensure collection and
disposal 
of 
post-

Supply Chain
Opportunity
Management
Setting up robust supply chain has
helped us in business continuity and
growth.
Our supply chain has also ensured
that we have competitive costs and
pass on its benefit to our consumers
without any business disruptions.
Our business continuity plan and
risk management plan has
covered all foreseeable risks in our
supply chain with measures
already under way to address
those.
Positive 
– 
Building
resilience in our supply
chain has helped us
fetch long-term results
and growth.
10.
Consumer
Opportunity
Welfare
To establish ourselves as market
leaders in the segment we operate
and become the most preferred
consumer brand by providing our
consumers with products that are
healthy and tasty.
We have put in tremendous effort
in launching new products which
fulfil unmet consumer needs. This has
been done through a process of
continuous innovation and resultant
high-quality products.
Sundrop Brands has supplemented
the process of innovation with the
building of a powerful distribution
network across the country.
Positive –
•
Brand reputation
and 
consumers’
loyalty.
•
Goodwill amongst
consumers 
helps
achieve 
increased
product sales.
11.

Risk
Compliance
Increases the cost of running a
business.
We have defined roles and
responsibilities in all the functions
and departments of the Company,
and they conform to meet all the
regulatory compliances under
applicable regulations. There are
also audit procedures to assess
compliance preparedness.

Opportunity
Continued development of new
products which address unmet

We have developed a strong R&D
team and in-house capabilities to
develop new and innovative
products.
Positive-
Fulfill 
the 
unmet
consumer needs by
providing 
superior
products 
to 
the
consumer
The raw materials used in the
manufacturing of our products are
critical and are specific to certain
geographies.
The environmental risk due to
changing climatic conditions,
dynamic pricing of commodities,
regulatory restrictions for sourcing
particular raw material, not finding
the responsible suppliers may pose
a risk to our raw materials and their
availability.
We have put processes in place
for 
alternative 
sourcing
locations, alternate suppliers for
substitutes of raw materials to
deal 
with 
instances 
of
unavailability for any reason.
Negative-
In certain areas, we
have limited supplier
base 
and 
the
vulnerability of the
supply 
chain 
to
external factors is
beyond control. A
supply discontinuity or
increasing input cost in
cases of short supply
poses a financial risk.
14.
Business
Risk

Ensure healthy products and
govern business with ethics.
Regulatory and legal challenges
associated with the nature of the
business we are in, is seen as a risk.
We have ensured a strong ethical
business culture, undertaking
measures to have effective risk
management such as responsible
marketing and distribution of
products.
Negative-
• Increased
operational costs in
audit and various
checks.
• Punitive actions by

The Company does not have a dedicated anti-corruption or anti-bribery policy. Our operations are
governed as per the Code of Conduct (Coc). The document is applicable to all the employees who must
abide by the values of the Company. The code compels the employees to be ethical, accountable, and
transparent in their day-to-day office work and addresses issues beyond corruption and bribery. The CoC
is adopted to set forth the basic standards of ethical behavior, detection & prevention of any wrongdoing.
It also lays down additional provisions for the board members as well as Key Management Personnel
(KMP) for compliance with the code.

No, the Company does not have a formal procedure for sustainable sourcing. However, the Company
has a supply chain process in place which provides guidance on sustainable sourcing. At an all-India
level, preference is always given to sourcing from local suppliers, thus reducing the supply chain emission
and supporting the local employment.

The Company  has identified the EHS Risk Management framework as one of the integral steps towards
building a robust safety management system. This framework entails a set of processes for continual risk
identification, assessment and mitigation, with active participation of the workforce in each of its facilities.
Half yearly safety audits are being conducted to assess the work-related Hazards. Safety week celebration
and ‘spot a hazard’ exercises are carried out to encourage workers to identify hazards. HIRA (Hazard
Identification and Risk Assessment) is conducted across the factories to identify and eliminate the hazard
by the Employees as well as workers. Work Permits, Near Miss reporting system are some other routine
processes to identify and report work related hazard.

Sundrop Brands believes in a robust relationship with the stakeholders. Any individual or group of individuals
or institution that adds value to the business of the Company is identified as a core stakeholder. We
recognized both internal stakeholders, which includes employees and leadership team, and external
stakeholders, which includes external channels such as regulators, suppliers, investors, and community.
The Company reaches out to various groups of identified stakeholders through calls, questionnaire forms
and meetings to gauge their views.

rights. The employees are mandated to abide by this policy. Additionally, extracts of the Factory Act
prohibiting child/bonded Labour and minimum wages are displayed in all the factory premises for perusal
of all direct/indirect employees. We will enhance the coverage for topics under human rights through

The Risk Management Policy framework encompasses the identification of internal and external risks across
various facets of the company, including front-end and back-end operations, R&D, Finance, and IT. It
addresses financial, operational, sectoral, sustainability, information, cyber security, disaster recovery,
strategic, and other risks, as determined by the Risk Management Committee. This policy aims to minimise
adverse impacts on business objectives by outlining procedures for risk quantification, categorisation,
mitigation measures, Critical Risk Control and Montoring, and Business Continuity Planning. The core
management team periodically deliberates on Business Continuity Plans, conducting business impact
analyses to identify critical functions and resources. Additionally, the company maintains a comprehensive
Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (EPRP) to address accidents, health emergencies, and
environmental impacts. The company reviews and revises the emergency preparedness and response
procedures on a regular interval. The Company’s corporate office is in a LEED Platinum leased premise
and the disaster preparedness is a part of the agreement with the lessor.

The Company has a well-defined mechanism for handling consumer grievances. The Company gives a
toll-free number along with an email address on its products label as well as on the Company's website
through which consumers can raise their complaints or query or feedback. The first response to all consumer
grievances is given immediately on receiving the call by having a detailed conversation with the consumer
to address his/her concern and timely closure of complaint. For other specific or technical query or
information or product issues, estimated turnaround time is given to the consumer and complaints are
forwarded to local area representatives for speedy response/closure and replacement to be provided to
consumers, if required.
