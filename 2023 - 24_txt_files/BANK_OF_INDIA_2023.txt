1 
Data Privacy 
Risk  
The instance of a data 
breach poses a 
substantial risk to the 
exposure of our 
customers' personally 
identifiable information. 
This could jeopardize our 
business relationships by 
compromising the 
confidentiality, integrity, 
and security of sensitive 
customer data. Such a 
breach has the potential 
to undermine trust and 
damage our reputation. 
The bank has an – IT Strategy & 
Digital Payment Promotion 
Committee (ITS&DPDC) in place. The 
Committee was formed in 
compliance of guidelines issued by 
Reserve Bank of India to take 
decision on IT Strategies and to 
monitor the development in the area 
of IT Projects. IT Strategy Committee 
consists of Executive Directors, 
Government Nominee Director and 
three other Non-Executive 
Independent Directors.  Bank is 
vigilant of the security and privacy of 
the data related to its patrons and 
account holders and takes utmost 
care to protect it from cyber-attacks. 
Bank has put in place Captive 
Security Operation Centre (SOC). 
Bank has implemented information 
security tools for Real-Time 
monitoring of 
Information Security breach attempts 
/ incidents / events on 24x7 basis in 
order to timely prevent, detect and 
respond. 
Advanced security tools like SIEM 
(Security Information and Event 
Management), PIM (Privilege Identity 
Management), DAM (Database 
Activity Monitoring), WAF (Web 
Application Firewall), NBAD (Network 
Behaviour Anomaly Detection), Anti-
APT (Advance Persistence Threat) for 
Web & Email Channels and Anti-
DDoS, Data DLP (Data Leakage 
Prevention) are some of the many 
security solutions are deployed. The 
Bank is ISO 27001:2013 (ISMS) and 
ISO 22301:2012 (BCMS) certified. 
Negative: If a data 
breach occurs, the Bank 
would face negative 
impacts on its business 
operations, including 
service disruptions, 
financial losses, 
reputational damage, 
and a loss of customer 
trust. Additionally, such 
incidents would 
increase the risk of 
regulatory scrutiny and 
potential penalties 
from authorities. 
2 
Business 
Continuity 
Risk 
The lack of business 
continuity or disaster 
management systems 
could result in financial 
losses and disruptions to 
the bank's critical 
operations, including 
those involving 
personnel, information, 
infrastructure, and 
facilities. 
Bank of India has been certified with 
“ISO 22301:2019 for Business 
continuity Management System”. 
Negative: Ineffective 
responses to 
contingencies can result 
in financial losses, 
reduced workforce 
productivity, and 
obstacles to the 
company's long-term 
growth plans.

Ethical 
Behaviour 
Risk 
The Bank is dedicated to 
maintaining ethical 
standards, demonstrating 
its commitment to 
integrity in all 
transactions. By 
prioritizing ethical 
behaviour, the Bank aims 
to retain its current 
clientele while attracting 
new customers. This 
commitment fosters 
trust, strengthens 
relationships, and 
solidifies the Bank's 
reputation as a reliable 
and reputable financial 
institution. 
The Bank strongly believes in ethical 
values and self-discipline 
to achieve higher standard of 
Corporate Governance and 
continues to strive for excellence in 
business operations through 
transparency, accountability to 
stakeholders, Government and 
others who deal with the Bank. Code 
of Conduct for Directors and Senior 
Management 
is posted on Bank’s website –

3-f8df-6d80-0b31- 
19b3bc4d3cdc?t=1663586179347 
Negative: Unethical 
conduct can directly 
damage the bank's 
reputation and reduce 
employee morale and 
productivity, thereby 
affecting overall 
growth. By upholding 
ethical standards and 
treating both 
customers and 
employees with 
integrity and respect, 
the bank fosters a 
positive workplace 
environment and 
strengthens customer 
relationships.

Systematic 
Risk 
Manageme
nt 
Risk  
This ensures financial 
stability, regulatory 
compliance, and the 
protection of 
stakeholders. By 
effectively identifying, 
assessing, and mitigating 
potential risks, it 
promotes continuous 
business operations, 
preserves the bank's 
reputation, and ensures 
long-term viability. These 
risks can arise from 
various factors, including 
financial, technological, 
or lending uncertainties. 
Such incidents or a series 
of events can threaten 
the overall stability of the 
system. 
“Enterprise wide Fraud Risk 
Management” framework for real-
time fraud monitoring is being 
effectively used for fraud monitoring 
and management. Bank has 
appropriate mechanism in place to 
ensure ongoing assessment of 
relevant risks on a Borrower Level as 
well as on a Portfolio level to 
maintain the trade-off between risks 
and returns. The Board of Directors 
of the Bank has an overall oversight 
of all risks in the Bank with specific 
Committees of the Board constituted 
to facilitate focused approach to 
specific risks. The Risk Management 
Committee of the Board (R.Com), is 
the subcommittee of the Board 
which is the apex body for Risk 
Management. The risk management 
policies and major control limits are 
approved by the Board of Directors 
and they are monitored and 
reviewed regularly.  
Negative: Failing to 
address unchecked 
risks that could escalate 
into systemic threats 
can severely impact the 
Bank's performance. 
These risks jeopardize 
the stability and 
trustworthiness of the 
financial system, 
potentially leading to 
disruptions, financial 
setbacks, and 
reputational damage.

Financial 
Inclusion 
Opportuni
ty 
Expanding financial 
inclusion provides access 
to banking services for 
marginalized and 
underprivileged 
communities, creating a 
positive societal impact 
and promoting broader 
economic development 
and stability. Increased 
business lending leads to 
higher turnover and 
wider outreach. 
Bank considers Financial Inclusion as 
a viable business proposition and has 
shifted outlook from “CSR” to 
“economic viability”. ICT based 
solution to support and secure 
sufficiently low cost transactions 
required by the financial sector. 
Financial inclusion drive gained 
momentum with Pradhan Mantri Jan 
Dhan Yojna (PMJDY) programme. 
Bank has provided banking services 
in unbanked rural areas through ICT 
led Business Correspondents model. 
Positive: Financial 
inclusion boosts the 
bank's profitability by 
expanding the 
customer base, growing 
deposits, and 
diversifying products, 
while simultaneously 
enhancing its 
reputation. 
6 
Customer 
fairness and 
right-selling 
Risk 
A deficiency in customer-
centric product offerings, 
value-added services, or 
unethical conduct can 
diminish trust and 
damage the bank's 
reputation. This 
underscores the 
significance of aligning 
products and services 
with customer needs 
while upholding ethical 
standards to uphold trust 
and protect the bank's 
image among 
stakeholders. 
The Bank has a Fair Practices Code in 
place. 
https://bankofindia.co.in/documents
/20121/0/Fair+Practices+code+on+Le
nders+Liability.pdf
Negative: The mis-
selling of products can 
negatively affect banks, 
leading to damage to 
their reputation, legal 
consequences, financial 
losses, customer 
attrition, operational 
disruptions, and 
employee morale 
issues.

Opportuni
ty 
This enhances efficiency, 
reduces employee 
turnover, boosts 
capabilities and creativity 
within the bank, and 
fosters diversity, 
ultimately enriching the 
customer experience. 
Bank aims to ensure seamless 
implementation of various HR 
initiatives launched by the Bank like 
Employee Engagement Survey, Job 
Family, Succession 
Planning & Talent Management 
Process and any other Government 
directive envisaged in PSB Reforms 
Agenda for Enhanced Access & 
Service Excellence 
(EASE). Our Bank has concluded 
employee engagement survey on the 
theme `Employee Development and 
Wellness’ and shall shortly 
implement the focus areas 
brought out in the same. 
Positive: A strong 
workforce marked by 
increased engagement, 
retention, and diversity 
brings forth diverse 
perspectives, varied 
experiences, and 
innovative ideas. This 
drives performance 
improvement and 
nurtures a positive 
organizational culture, 
demonstrating the 
company's dedication 
to creating a supportive 
work environment.

Regulatory & 
Legal 
Compliances
Risk   
The risk of non-
compliance exposes the 
bank to legal penalties 
and financial losses due 
to its failure to comply 
with industry laws and 
regulations. Banks that 
prioritize compliance 
often see improved 
performance and 
increased process 
efficiency. Compliance 
provides assurance and 
gives investors a better 
understanding of the 
bank's operations. 
Bank has an independent Compliance 
Department which is headed by an 
officer of the rank of Chief General 
Manager who is for regulatory 
purposes also referred to as Chief 
Compliance Officer. The core 
function of the department is to 
ensure compliance of statutory, 
regulatory and Bank's internal 
guidelines for both domestic as well 
as overseas operations. The 
department is the single point of 
contact for RBI and ensures smooth 
conduct of Risk Based Supervision 
(RBS) as per prevalent SPARC 
framework. Bank has a Board 
approved Compliance Function Policy 
which is framed as per Reserve Bank 
of India guidelines and is reviewed & 
updated annually.  
Negative: Non-
compliance would lead 
to reputational 
damage, affecting 
business operations. 
Banks that follow 
regulatory laws are 
better equipped to 
manage risks and 
promote a culture of 
fairness and loyalty 
among employees.

the Bank's operations is 
of utmost importance.

manage these risks could 
negatively impact 
operations and 
profitability, inviting 
scrutiny from 
stakeholders/investors 
and influencing public 
perception of the bank.

e-waste out of which 100% is 
recycled. The bank has completed 
solar installation in 6 premises and 
are initiating the process for another

building- Star House 2 has obtained 
Green Building certificate for using 
Green Building concept in the

conditioning requirement are used to 
the minimum by adopting the 
concept of Green building. For Air-
conditioned systems, regulation of 
timing and optimum room 
temperature maintained at all times

R & D 
 Considering the nature of operation as a financial service provider, R&D outlay and capital expenditure were 
restricted to investments made in Information Technology systems. Our R&D endeavours primarily aim at 
process enhancement, notably through product digitization. Over the year, the Bank has implemented 
significant initiatives to digitize customer offerings, thereby enhancing transparency and accessibility to our 
products and services. Furthermore, digitization has resulted in a reduction in paper-based processes, 
contributing to the Bank's efforts to minimize its carbon footprint. Investments have been directed towards 
the addition of IT capital assets to enhance the Bank's digital initiatives, such as Internet banking, Mobile 
banking, and ATM Channels, as well as software licenses, development of various IT applications, and 
improvement of security and network infrastructures, including Data centers.

a.  
Does the entity have 
procedures in place for 
sustainable sourcing? 
(Yes/No) 
The Bank being part of the service industry, consumption of resources is limited. 
The Bank endeavours to procure sustainable products from local suppliers at fair 
prices. Some of the key initiatives undertaken by the bank in this regard include: 
-Prioritizing energy-efficient equipment, such as star-rated air-conditioners, 
laptops, computers, and lighting devices, which are assessed based on energy 
efficiency standards in all branches and offices. 
-Procuring other items, such as stationery, locally by the offices/branches as per 
their requirements. 
b. 
If yes, what percentage 
of inputs were sourced 
sustainably? 
As a financial services provider, the Bank's operations do not heavily rely on 
material resources. Nonetheless, as a responsible corporate entity, the Bank 
prioritizes maximizing resource consumption efficiency, minimizing waste 
generation, and enhancing process efficiency and productivity. While the 
digitization of products and services has decreased the need for paper, it still 
constitutes a significant resource in the Bank's daily operations. Therefore, the 
Bank has intensified efforts to further reduce paper consumption by expanding 
recycling practices, sourcing paper from sustainable sources, and streamlining 
internal printing requirements.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of

The Bank has implemented a centralized and robust E-waste management system to 
identify and collect E-waste generated at its branches/offices. This waste is then 
collected by a vendor and disposed of at the vendor’s Recycling and Recovery Unit. Given 
our status as a financial service provider, plastic waste generation is minimal. However, 
starting from the fiscal year 2023-24, we have begun accounting for any plastic waste 
generated by our branches/offices. This waste is disposed of through local arrangements 
with 
respective 
Corporations/Municipalities/Panchayats.
The disposal of the Bank's surplus or obsolete IT assets and resources, such as desktop 
computers, servers, and storage, must comply with legal requirements and

We have been engaged by Bank of India (the Bank) pursuant to SEBI Circular No. 
SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated July 12, 2023 ("the Circular") to provide an 
Independent Reasonable Assurance with respect to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) / 
metrics under nine (9) ESG attributes (BRSR Core), forming part of the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for the financial year ended March 31, 2024. 
As our Reasonable Assurance engagement has been with respect to the Financial Year ended 
March 31, 2024, we have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any 
other elements included in BRSR and, therefore, do not express any opinion thereon. 
Management's Responsibility 
The Bank is responsible for identification of key aspects of BRSR, engagement with 
stakeholders, and content and preparation of BRSR in accordance with the Circular mentioned 
above. This responsibility includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal 
control relevant to the preparation of BRSR and the measurement of KPls, such that they are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Inherent limitations 
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and 
measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and 
measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities. In addition, 
Greenhouse gas ('GHG') quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of 
incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine, emissions factors and the values needed 
to combine emissions of different gases.
