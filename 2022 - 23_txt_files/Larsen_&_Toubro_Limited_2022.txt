Statement by Director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets, and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure).
	
L&T is an Indian multinational engaged in EPC Projects, Hi-Tech Manufacturing and Services operating in over 60 
countries worldwide. A strong, customer-focused approach and a constant quest for excellence have enabled L&T to 
attain and sustain leadership in its businesses for over eight decades. The Company is engaged in core and high impact 
sectors of the economy and its integrated capabilities span the entire spectrum of ‘design- to- delivery’. 
	
On the environment front, the Company has committed to achieve Water Neutrality by 2035 and Carbon Neutrality by 
2040. The decarbonisation targets are based on intensity reduction on year-on-year basis and have been cascaded to 
all businesses through their respective strategy plans. As the Company continues to pursue a strong growth path, the 
challenge is to balance its growth aspirations while aiming to minimise the impact on the environment. The primary focus 
is to achieve these goals through improvement in energy efficiency of operations and increased use of renewable energy.

Business Responsibility & 
Sustainability Reporting
	
While recognising the challenges in implementing the initiatives over 700 project sites, with many of them in remote 
locations, multiple initiatives have been taken. The initiatives are focused on reducing diesel consumption through 
optimisation of plant and machinery, switching from diesel generators (DG) to grid power, replacement of old DG sets 
with new ones, upgrading HVAC systems, use of energy efficient lighting systems and replacing DG powered equipment 
with electrically powered ones. Measures have also been identified to increase the share of renewable power in the total 
electricity consumption mix by installing on-site solar panels, sourcing through power purchase agreements, green tariffs 
etc. Through renewables, the Company has avoided emissions equivalent to 29,116 tCO2e during FY 2022-23.
	
Overall, the emission intensity is similar to FY 2021-22 level despite significant pick-up in execution and on-site activities 
due to a continuously growing order book. The full-scale implementation benefits from the various initiatives would start 
accruing in the coming years.
	
Through the increased use of eco-friendly and recyclable materials, which as a percentage of total input materials, has 
improved from 18% in FY 2021-22 to 24% in FY 2022-23. The Company has avoided emissions of 684,669 tCO2e during 
the year mainly from use of fly ash and steel plant slag. In addition, recognising the importance of circular economy, 551 
employees have been trained on technical and operational dimensions of the subject.
	
To enable biodiversity conservation, the Company has taken up a mangrove plantation project in Hazira, which will help 
in storage of blue carbon. The Company has been planting native and multi species trees and it has planted more than 
1.9 million saplings in FY 2022-23 and cumulatively more than 8 million saplings over the years. 
	
The Company also lays emphasis on water recycling and conservation in line with its Water Neutrality goals. During the 
year, the use of treated water from STPs has reduced freshwater demand by 389,802 kl. The Company has improved 
water consumption intensity by 8.9%.
	
The Company plans to achieve a Green Business portfolio share of revenue of 40% by FY 2025-26 and has made good 
progress by achieving 37% in FY 2022-23. The Company is steadily developing its portfolio which comprises projects 
embedded with advanced technology, solutions centred around renewables, water and effluent treatment plants, 
efficient power distribution, mass transit systems (metro and high-speed rail) and green buildings. L&T commissioned 
its pilot Green Hydrogen plant at the A. M. Naik Heavy Engineering Complex at Hazira and entered into a technology 
partnership for manufacturing electrolysers. The Company was recognised as global No. 3 in the ‘Top 200 Environmental 
Firms’ list in terms of green revenue by Environment News Record (ENR), a globally reputed publication for the 
construction industry worldwide. 
	
The Company’s focus is on providing equal opportunity, ensuring diversity and inclusion, workplace safety and well-being 
for all employees and workers. The Company, especially the EPC businesses employ around 277,000 contract workers 
and ensure measures to provide healthy and safe working conditions. Learning and development receives close attention. 
During the year 37,097 employees and over 277,000 workers have been trained in various skills, health and well-being, 
safety, etc. The Company’s gender diversity stands at 7.1% and it aims to achieve 10% by FY 2025-26.
	
Corporate Social Responsibility or CSR has been taken up by L&T long before it became mandatory. The Company’s 
thrust area is the sustainable growth of the country’s social infrastructure such as water and sanitation, education, 
health and skill-building. Through these focus areas, the Company strives to improve the quality of life, mitigate social 
inequalities, build self-sufficiency, and help individuals achieve their true potential in the identified communities through 
its CSR activities. During FY 2022-23, 1.5 million lives have been impacted through the Company’s CSR initiatives. Several 
initiatives such as establishment and running of L&T Health centres, support to public welfare schemes of Prayas Trust 
and L&T Public Charitable Trust are part of the Company’s efforts at improving livelihood and resilience of communities. 
The Company’s Integrated Community Development Programmes (ICDP), which was initiated seven years ago, provides 
assistance to rural communities, especially in remote water-scarce locations of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan. ,. 
These locations, covering an area of 36,527 ha, have become self-sustaining, and the Company has started to replicate 
the model in other locations. In the ICDP locations, the water table has risen by 1.5 metres on an average from the 
baseline. In total, more than 24,000 households have been covered through these programmes.
	
Cyber security has emerged as a key concern for businesses across the world. Evolving and innovative cyber weapons are 
deployed to access sensitive data and demand ransom for its safe return. The Company has developed a robust multi-year 
cyber security and resiliency roadmap and made investments in state-of-the-art security platforms/tools and technologies. 
The Company has implemented a groupwide Cyber Risk Assurance Framework and operationalised one of the most 
advanced Security Operations Centre to monitor cyber incidences on 24X7 basis and respond effectively when required

On the governance front, the Management and the Board are involved in reviewing the Company’s ESG performance on 
a regular basis. The Company periodically reviews key policies such as Sustainability Policy, Supplier Code of Conduct, etc. 
During the year, the Equal Opportunity Policy and ‘Public Policy Advocacy’ Policy were released. The Company has fair 
and transparent governance and disclosure practices, through the Code of Conduct, Whistle-blower Policy and other 
detailed procedures to ensure compliance and uphold its principles. In addition, the Company has formulated an Anti-
Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and released it in March 2023. Given its commitment to shareholder value creation, 
the Company acknowledges the importance of its business responsibility and sustainability policies and practices as its 
critical catalyst.

to Directors joining the Boards of other companies, and even conflicts which could take place in the course of normal 
business activities. The process allows the Directors to recuse themselves from the discussions pertaining to the conflict 
of interest. The Directors have to exercise their responsibilities in a bona fide manner in the interests of the Company. 
They should not allow any extraneous considerations that may vitiate their exercise of objective independent judgment in 
the paramount interest of the Company and not abuse their position to the detriment of the Company for the purpose 
of gaining direct or indirect personal advantage. Any conflict of interest arising with the Board Members needs to be 
reported to the Chairman of the Audit Committee/Chairman of the Board.

•	
The Company is in the process of understanding ESG performance of the supply chain. A Survey was initiated 
in 2023, starting with the top 25 suppliers (comprising 35% of procurement value of the construction business) 
being assessed on parameters related to the environment, human rights, CSR, health, safety and governance. 
The suppliers are also being evaluated for sustainable sourcing wherein the Company is checking their 
adherence to ISO 14001:2015, 45001:2018, OHSAS 18001 SA 8000, etc.
	
	
•	
Supply chain partners are also trained in various aspects of ESG. During this year, the Company conducted more 
than 85,000 training sessions and awareness programmes, covering around 200 topics related to safety, human 
rights, environment, etc., for the Company’s workers and sub-contractors.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
44 out of top 50 suppliers are certified and compliant with social and environmental standards such as SA 8000, ISO 
14001, OHSAS 18001 which comprise 40% of procurement value of the construction business.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end 
of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
The Company does not have any specific product to reclaim at the end of life. However, at project and operation sites, 
there are systems in place to recycle, reuse and dispose of waste generated during the course of construction and 
operation. This is done in line with regulatory requirements.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
In India, EPR is applicable for plastic waste and electronics waste and recently it is mandated for import of items with 
plastic packaging. The Company has businesses in EPC projects and Hi-Tech Manufacturing and does not manufacture 
any plastic products. In 2022, the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC) made changes to EPR 
and extended the coverage of the rule to firms (importers) which generate plastic waste due to packaging of imported 
material or equipment. The company has registered as an importer under the EPR through the CPCB Portal, and the 
application is currently under review since its submission. Notwithstanding the recent changes, the business units of the

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1.	
Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing 
industry) or for its services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details in the following format?
	
The Company undertook a cradle-to-gate LCA (starting from sourcing of material to dispatch of finished product) of a 
reactor manufactured by Heavy Engineering business in FY2021-22. These reactors process biomass (recycled animal fats, 
used cooking oil and inedible corn oil) to make green diesel which has up to 80% lower GHG emission compared to 
conventional diesel. A LCA study showed that the maximum impact was due to embodied carbon of the steel and energy 
consumption in the manufacturing process. 
	
Note: The Company’s product portfolio is less than 10% of the turnover

LCA study concludes that maximum environmental 
impact is associated with procurement of primary raw 
material (steel) and the energy consumption (grid 
source) associated with the manufacturing process. 
Other than these, there are almost negligible impacts 
in the manufacturing process.
It has been recommended to explore green steel or 
recycled steel for manufacturing this product without 
compromising quality. Also, it has been advised to 
consider using renewable source of energy in the 
manufacturing process. Management is evaluating its 
feasibility.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
As a part of the EHS Management system, a project-specific EHS plan is prepared at the commencement of every new 
project, which determines the broad parameters of EHS management. This plan identifies the hazardous operations 
and the risks arising from such hazards which are within the scope of the work. It also specifies the required integrated 
preventive measures (controls) to mitigate the same.
	
The Management provides strong, demonstrable and visible leadership and commitment to EHS through personal 
examples and actions. This forms the crux of the Live Injury-Free Each Day (L.I.F.E) goal. . Management personnel 
participate in EHS meetings, conduct site inspections and Audits, to encourage and develop a positive attitude 
towards EHS within L&T projects and operations. The Management ensure that adequate resources were available and 
responsibilities allocated for implementing the L&T LIFE framework. Roles and responsibilities, targets and objectives, 
goals, training needs and required conduct is clearly defined, agreed and communicated across the organisation.

Furthermore to support, there is a systematic risk management process in place to identify and control hazards in 
projects/units which require verification of conformity. Therefore, a process has been established for carrying out internal 
EHS audits. This process mandates organising internal audits for active projects, and it is verified by audit teams specific 
to each business, at least once in six months.
	
Certain projects were selected for frequent auditing, depending on their status, importance, and risk profile. This was in 
addition to any external audits carried out by accredited auditors.

Working Conditions
15.	 Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety-related incidents (if any) and on 
significant risks/concerns arising from assessments of health and safety practices and working conditions.
	
The Company’s EHS Council undertakes a review of the accidents and incidents, and formulates procedures based on 
risk analysis of data gathered through various businesses. It makes use of advanced technology such as vison analytics/
AI to detect any health and safety hazards and gather data. This data is used for predictive analysis, measurement of 
incidents and unsafe behaviours. This enables identification of the key areas of risk which in turn guides the projects to 
proactively manage and focus resources to prevent any accidents or incidents. Such analysis is shared throughout the 
group businesses structure, to support L&T’s Mission ZERO HARM objective.
	
Efforts have been made in understanding the Company’s high-risk profile holistically. EHS risk management culture has 
been inculcated across the Company. Steps taken include:
	
•	
Implementation of HSE Surveillance Rating
	
•	
Developed HSE Training Modules on high-risk activities 
	
•	
Developed standardized template of HSE Lessons Learnt (EHS Alert) and these alerts are shared in the centralized 
knowledge sharing platform which can be accessed by the employees
	
•	
Inducted Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) into the HSES Management Community of central knowledge sharing 
module
	
•	
Inter business EHS Audits to evaluate and reinforce EHSMS for lateral sharing of best EHS practices. 
	
•	
Implementation of Behaviour Based Safety to reinforce positive safe behaviour at workplaces and trends and monitor 
action for improvement of BBS culture across project sites.
	
•	
Senior Management audits based on standard checklist developed by the EHS Council. 
Integrated Annual Report 2022-23

Sustainability Reporting
	
These efforts have led to a capture of data on high-risk hazardous activities in L&T’s Business verticals. This helps to devise 
an action plan to enhance the ability of stakeholders to manage such activities with a higher degree of awareness and 
suitable training − using technology such as AR/VR from external agencies as well as subject matter experts. Employees 
strive to achieve EHS excellence in their respective functions and align their actions and business decisions.

a consolidated performance report and outcome is presented to the Board in their quarterly meet. The Company has 
also been conducting stakeholder engagement exercises from time to time on ESG topics. This stakeholder engagement 
exercise proceeds on a structural approach on frequency, delegation and reporting of outcome, including stakeholders’ 
feedback to the Board. As per their respective terms of reference, the various Committees (statutory as well as internal) 
meet periodically to review the performance of the Company in relevant areas.

Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, 
and social topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders 
on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity. 
	
The Company continuously engages with its stakeholders to boost relationships, thus enabling the Company to be 
informed of their expectations, as well as opportunities for value creation. A structured approach and systems are in place 
to engage with the stakeholders at different levels for identifying, prioritising and addressing their needs and concerns 
in a consistent and systematic manner. While conducting the materiality assessment in FY 2021-22, inputs from key 
stakeholders (NGO partners, suppliers, employees, senior management, etc.) were taken to enable prioritising of material 
topics of the Company which are important to the stakeholders as well as the Company. Below are a few examples of 
how stakeholder inputs have been incorporated into policies and activities:
	
Communities: The Company focuses on four thematic areas, viz. water, health, education and skill development - 
primarily for the communities around L&T’s factories, campuses, and establishments. After identifying a location, a 
need-assessment study is conducted through Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA). PRA with the community during the 
project planning and development phase helps in understanding their issues related to water availability, sanitation, 
livelihood, migration, education and health, potential solutions and challenges in implementing the interventions. The 
need assessment specifies the number of villages or urban slum pockets, students or trainees, schools/households to be 
covered, current facilities, and specific vulnerable community groups. Based on the outcomes of the need assessment, 
proposals are invited from reputed NGOs and implementation partners keeping in mind presence and expertise in the 
Integrated Annual Report 2022-23

Sustainability Reporting
selected location. During implementation, various stakeholder groups are formed, such as Self-Help Groups (SHGs), 
Village Development Committees, School Management Committees, and Health Committees to participate, guide and 
monitor decision-making and implementation. These groups participate and guide in decision-making and monitor 
the interventions at the community level. The inputs and feedback received from such stakeholder groups are further 
incorporated to enhance the benefits of the CSR projects. Additionally, capacity building, training and exposure visits are 
also organised to strengthen the community’s understanding and involvement.
	
Shareholders: In addition to its ongoing interactions with analysts representing institutional equity investors , the 
Company conducted an investor feedback survey to build into its long-term strategic plan - ‘LAKSHYA 2026’. As part 
of this exercise, several suggestions from key investors and analysts were received related to energy transition and ESG. 
This is one of the reasons of L&T to enter the green hydrogen business. The Company also received suggestions for more 
proactive outreach to ESG rating agencies and funds as well as improving granularity of ESG disclosures. Recognising the 
growing interest in this area and factoring in feedback from investor interactions, the Company has been conducting 
regular interactions with relevant stakeholders including global funds, institutional investors, rating agencies, etc., to 
keep them updated about activities and progress on various initiatives being undertaken to achieve its carbon and water 
neutrality goals. 
	
Employees: The management believes in an effective two-way communication process: top-down and bottom-up. In 
this regard, there are structured systems of employee communication and engagement initiatives that starts from project 
director/business heads visits and interactions with employees, HR manager visits and townhalls, and senior management 
visits from time-to-time and interactions with employees and the workers. There are Employee Relation Officers at the 
project sites and with support of the Workmen Development Centres, they oversee and interact, take workers’ feedback 
from time-to-time on various aspects of living, work conditions, health and welfare, etc. Depending on the feedback 
from the channels as stated above, including the survey findings, HR heads of individual businesses, with the support 
of their cluster/project HR managers, also undertake surveys as per the need on various topics related to organisational 
development and effectiveness. The findings are discussed with project/business heads and corrective actions are taken to 
enhance the organisational effectiveness.

different types of waste bins, segregation at source, classification of waste according to their properties, origin and type, 
different disposal methods depending on the waste categories, tie-up with authorised vendors to ensure proper disposal 
and adherence to Environment Management System (ISO 14001:2015), wherever applicable. One of the businesses also 
recycles steel waste generated from its projects through fabrication, ensuring that it is reused in the main production 
process.
	
For hazardous waste generated during operations, there are separate collection and storage facilities, and is disposed 
at regular intervals in line with the Central and State Pollution Control Board regulations through authorised vendors. 
Some sites also display safety data sheets explaining handling and storage of hazardous chemicals. Disposal of hazardous 
waste is in accordance with Hazardous Waste Management Rules 2016 and State Pollution Control Board guidelines. The 
biomedical waste is disposed of with the help of authorised hospitals nearby and handed over to an authorised agency 
for treatment and disposal. Biomedical waste generation, treatment and disposal is guided by the Biomedical Waste 
Management Rules, 2016.
	
The businesses also conduct regular training and awareness programmes on waste minimisation, recycling, and 
management techniques for employees and workers responsible for waste management. In emergency situations, the 
Company also provides suitable firefighting arrangements, spill kits, and drip trays for safe handling and storage of waste 
materials.

Plant & machinery (P&M) in construction 
projects primarily use diesel as power source. 
The Company has undertaken various 
operational improvement initiatives, e.g. 
increasing the utilisation of P&M, reducing 
idling time, reducing fuel wastage, fuel 
budgeting for equipment, replacing older 
equipment with new ones, etc.
Estimated to help reduce 7,547 tCO2e in 
emissions on account of optimisation in 
diesel consumption.
2.

Increase in renewable energy 
component as part of electricity 
consumption
The Company has taken initiatives over 
the years to increase renewable energy 
component in the electricity consumption 
mix. These have been done through 
installation of rooftop solar and third-party 
power purchase agreements. In FY 2022-23, 
the Company has installed additional 
rooftop solar capacity at its manufacturing 
facility in Hazira
Initiative was implemented towards end of 
Q2 in FY 2022-23 and expected to avoid 
492 tCO2e in emissions annually.
4.
Implementation of technologies to 
reduce consumption of materials
In highway projects, certain projects require 
rehabilitation of existing roads. The typical 
process requires new materials to be 
sourced for relaying the layers. This year, 
the Company deployed the Cold Central 
Plant Recycling technology in some projects 
to recycle material from existing roads, and 
reduce consumption of virgin material. 
Additionally, this process utilises a technique 
which requires lower energy consumption 
compared to the Hot Recycling process.
Helped avoid two million tonnes of virgin 
material (aggregates). Helped in avoiding 
10,924 tCO2e in emissions from energy 
consumption) and 1,520 tCO2e in emissions 
from materials used.
5.
Use of treated water from Sewage 
Treatment Plants
Construction projects require water 
for various activities, e.g., concreting, 
equipment washing, etc. The Company 
began sourcing treated water from sewage 
treatment plants (of municipal corporations) 
to meet the water needs of some projects. 
This helped to reduce freshwater demand.
Helped avoid freshwater demand of 
389,800 kL
