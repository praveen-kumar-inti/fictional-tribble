I, Mr Milind Shinde, Chairman of your Company, NGL Fine-Chem Limited, would like to share with you our vision and values on 
business responsibility and sustainability. We believe that being a responsible and sustainable business is not only good for the 
planet but also for our stakeholders and our long-term growth. We are committed to making a positive impact on the environment, 
society and governance (ESG) aspects of our business, and to disclosing our performance transparently.
We have adopted the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) framework, which aligns with the National 
Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC), to report on our ESG practices and priorities. The BRSR helps us establish 
links between our financial results and our ESG performance and communicate them effectively to our regulators, investors and 
other stakeholders.
Our business responsibility and sustainability strategy are guided by our core values of excellence, integrity, innovation, respect 
and collaboration. We strive to deliver high-quality products to our customers, while minimising our environmental footprint, 
enhancing our social impact and ensuring good governance. We also engage with our suppliers, partners and communities to 
promote responsible and sustainable practices across our value chain.
We are proud of our achievements in business responsibility and sustainability, but we also recognise that there is always room 
for improvement. This is the first year of BRSR reporting for your Company, and we are reporting on the essential indicators only 
and your Company endeavours to report on the leadership indicator in later parts. We, believe that  together, we can create a more 
responsible and sustainable future for our Company and society.

consciousness and its

EHS management 
system with periodical 
internal and external 
audits of the safety 
practices.
2.    Adoption of 
comprehensive 
corrective action plans 
post the identification 
and assessment of 
safety incidents to 
prevent any such future 
instances.
Positive: Robust 
Occupational, Health

approach enables the
