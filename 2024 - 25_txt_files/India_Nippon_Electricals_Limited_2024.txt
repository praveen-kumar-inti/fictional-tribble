topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were

One of the most important factors in choosing our material topics is the input from stakeholder engagements. Based on the 
feedback we get from stakeholders through ongoing engagement material topics are identified. For example, the community-

firmed up by the Board.
