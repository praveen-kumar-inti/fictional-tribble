	 Moreover, during the Financial year 2022-23, Avanti Frozen Foods INC, a foreign subsidiary of the 
Company with a 60% shareholding, underwent dissolution. This decision was primarily driven by the 
adverse effects of COVID-19 and subsequent recession in the U.S. After careful evaluation, the Board 
concluded that establishing a U.S. entity was not considered promising, leading to the decision to dissolve 
the U.S. subsidiary. Accordingly, Avanti Frozen Foods INC was officially dissolved on 27th March, 2023.

Labor  
Prac-
tices
Opportu-
nity
Opportunity

working environment can 
improve the productivity 
and quality of work per-
formed by employees. This 
can lead to improved prod-
uct quality and customer 
satisfaction,

3.
Selling  
Practic-
esv
Opportu-
nity
•	 The shrimp feed industry 
is highly competitive, with 
many companies offering 
similar products. Adopting 
unique selling practices can 
help the company differen-
tiate its products and stand 
out from the competition, 
which can attract more 
customers 
and 
increase 
sales.
•	 With the global demand 
for shrimp increasing, par-
ticularly in countries like the 
United States, Japan, and 
Europe, there is a grow-
ing market for high-quality 
shrimp feed and as such 
selling practices like engag-
ing with international buy-
ers, participating in trade 
shows, 
and 
complying 
with international regula-
tions, Avanti can tap into 
this market and expand our 
business.
•	 By providing excellent cus-
tomer service, building trust 
with customers, and offer-
ing customized solutions to 
their needs, company can 
build customer loyalty and 
establish ourselves as a re-
liable and trusted source of 
high-quality shrimp feed.
NA
Positive  
implication:
Implementing effec-
tive selling practices 
can lead to increased 
market 
share 
and 
revenue growth over 
time.
Adopting more effi-
cient and streamlined 
selling practices can 
result in cost savings
4.
Energy 
Man-
age-
ment
Opportu-
nity
•	 Effective energy manage-
ment can help the Com-
pany reduce its energy 
consumption and lower 
the energy bills, leading to 
cost savings as production 
of feed requires energy-
intensive processes such 
as grinding, mixing, and 
extrusion
•	 Implementing energy prac-
tices can reduce a com-
pany's carbon footprint 
and contribute to environ-
mental sustainability as 
energy consumption is a 
significant contributor to 
greenhouse gas emissions.
NA
Positive implication.
Avanti follows energy 
management practic-
es such as equipment 
optimization 
and 
maintenance, reduc-
ing waste, and using 
renewable 
energy 
sources to an extent 
which could result in 
significant cost sav-
ing, increased profit-
ability, improved cash 
flow.

Quality 
& Safety
Opportu-
nity
•	 The Company can tap into 
growing demand for quality 
and safe shrimp feed and 
increase their market share.
•	 High-quality 
and 
safe 
shrimp feed can command 
premium prices in the mar-
ket and help build a loyal 
customer base.
•	 Avanti can differentiate it-
self from competitors by 
producing high-quality and 
safe feeds. Customers are 
more likely to purchase 
products from companies 
that have a good reputation 
for quality and safety.
NA
Positive implication:
Avanti 
has 
estab-
lished clear quality 
and safety standards 
for the production of 
shrimp feeds based 
on 
recognized 
in-
dustry best practices 
and regulatory re-
quirements. 
Quality 
control measures are 
implemented at every 
stage of the produc-
tion process, staffs 
are trained on the 
importance of qual-
ity and safety and 
thereby with these 
measures, the high-
quality shrimp feed 
we produce can at-
tract a loyal customer 
base thus resulting in 
increase their reve-
nue and profitability.
6.
Mate-
rials 
Sourcing 
& Effi-
ciency
Opportu-
nity
•	 Efficient sourcing and use 
of materials can help the 
Company to reduce pro-
duction costs, which can 
ultimately lead to lower 
prices for customers.
•	 Sourcing high-quality ma-
terials can help company 
to produce better-quality 
shrimp feed, which can 
lead to improved growth 
rates and health for shrimp.
•	 By focusing on responsible 
sourcing and sustainability 
such as sourcing the mate-
rials from the verified and 
authorised 
vendors, 
the 
company can build custom-
er loyalty and strengthen its 
brand reputation.
Positive implication:
Avanti 
has 
imple-
mented 
responsible 
sourcing practices by 
identifying and part-
nering with suppliers 
who prioritize sus-
tainability and ethical 
sourcing. These prac-
tices can result into 
cost reduction, in-
creased revenue, im-
proved brand reputa-
tion, and compliance 
with regulations.

Risk and 
Opportu-

Risk
•	 The company requires a 
skilled workforce to man-
age various aspects of the 
business, such as hatch-
ery operations, feed man-
agement, disease control, 
and harvesting. However, 
there may be a shortage 
of skilled labour, which can 
lead to lower productivity 
and quality of the shrimp 
produced.
•	 The Company may experi-
ence high turnover rates 
due to the seasonal nature 
of the business and the 
physically demanding work.
Opportunity
•	 A 
skilled 
and 
engaged 
workforce can lead to im-
proved 
productivity 
and 
quality of the shrimp pro-
duced. This can result in in-
creased profitability for the 
business and a competitive 
advantage in the market.
•	 A highly skilled workforce 
can help drive innovation 
and growth that can lead 
to the development of new 
technologies, 
processes, 
and products that can help 
the Company meet chang-
ing consumer demands and 
improve sustainability.
•	 The Company provides em-
ployment opportunities in 
many communities. Invest-
ing in talent acquisition and 
management can have a 
positive impact on the lo-
cal workforce, resulting in 
economic growth and im-
proved living standards.
Avanti has a work-
force plan that can 
help to identify the 
current and future 
needs of the busi-
ness, 
including 
the required skills, 
knowledge, 
and 
experience. 
This 
can help to avoid a 
shortage of skilled 
labour and ensure 
the business has the 
right people in the 
right positions.
Providing access to 
training and devel-
opment 
programs 
can help to improve 
the skills and knowl-
edge of the work-
force, leading to in-
creased productivity 
and quality.
Positive and  
Negative  
implication:
The financial implica-
tions of talent acqui-
sition and manage-
ment for the Com-
pany can include in-
creased productivity, 
improved innovation, 
stronger 
customer 
relationships, and en-
hanced sustainability. 
However, there are 
also costs associat-
ed with recruitment, 
training, 
turnover, 
and skills gaps that 
must be managed.

“As the Director responsible for the Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report, I am thrilled to highlight our organization's strong commitment to 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. At Avanti, we strive for 
maximum compliance in terms of governance, environmental practices, and 
economic strategies. Our vision is not only to be a sustainability leader within 
our industry but also to set a benchmark across all sectors.
We firmly believe that integrating ESG considerations into our business 
operations is essential for long-term success and resilience. Our focus on 
ESG encompasses a wide range of initiatives, which extend beyond corporate 
social responsibility (CSR) efforts to address the broader context of sustainable 
business practices.
From an environmental standpoint, we are dedicated to minimizing our 
ecological footprint and preserving natural resources. We have implemented 
robust measures to reduce energy consumption, minimize waste generation, and 
mitigate environmental risks. Through innovative technologies and sustainable 
practices, we aim to contribute positively to the fight against climate change 
and promote a greener future.
On the social front, we recognize the importance of inclusivity, diversity, and 
community engagement. We are actively involved in initiatives that promote 
education, particularly among children, women, the elderly, and individuals 
with different abilities. By enhancing vocational skills and creating employment 
opportunities, we aim to uplift lives and empower communities. Additionally, 
we support initiatives that promote health and well-being, including preventive 
healthcare and sanitation programs, contributing to the broader societal goal of 
eradicating hunger, poverty, and malnutrition.
Governance remains a cornerstone of our organizational values. We adhere 
to the highest ethical standards, transparency, and accountability in all our 
operations. Our governance framework ensures effective risk management, 
stakeholder engagement, and regulatory compliance. We continuously assess 
and enhance our governance practices to maintain the trust of our stakeholders 
and uphold our commitment to integrity.
As the Director responsible for the Business Responsibility Report, I am proud 
to state that our organization is fully aligned with the principles of ESG. We 
consistently strive for excellence, continuously enhancing our strategies, and 
setting ambitious goals to drive positive change. By transparently sharing our 
sustainability performance and future objectives, we aim to inspire others and 
contribute to the larger goal of a sustainable and inclusive world.”

As a responsible organization, we understand the importance of 
identifying and mitigating work-related hazards and risks. In line 
with this commitment, our Company regularly conducts mock 
safety drills to evaluate our safety procedures and identify any 
potential hazards that may arise during work-related activities.
We also regularly engage with our on-field staff to collect feedback 
and assess any risks that they may have encountered or anticipated. 
This information is then analysed to determine potential risks and 
develop strategies to mitigate them.

Company may face and take proactive measures to reduce or 
eliminate them. This includes identifying potential safety hazards 
and implementing appropriate safety protocols and procedures

work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks.
At our Company, we believe that the best way to ensure a safe 
working environment is by encouraging feedback from our

encourage reporting of near misses, unsafe acts, and unsafe 
conditions. This dual benefit approach not only increases Health & 
Safety engagement but also helps to reduce risks through prompt 
rectification of the issues raised.
To facilitate this reporting process, each facility has a safety 
representative meeting on a quarterly basis, where safety 
representatives from the workforce can provide formal feedback on 
all safety matters. This provides a structured platform for workers 
to voice their concerns, make suggestions and receive feedback 
from management.
