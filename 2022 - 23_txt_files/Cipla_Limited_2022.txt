its impact on the environment. In FY 2022-23, we  initiated 
Life Cycle Assessments of four of our products, the results 
of which will be shared in the next Annual Report.   
	
By analysing the supply chain from raw material evaluation 
to product disposal, Cipla identifies areas where it can make 
more sustainable choices.  
2.	 If there are any significant social or environmental 
concerns and/or risks arising from production or 
disposal of your products / services, as identified 
in the Life cycle perspective / Assessments (LCA) 
or through any other means, briefly describe the 
same along-with action taken to mitigate the
