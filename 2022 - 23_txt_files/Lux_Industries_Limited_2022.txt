1.
Health and 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Occupational health and safety practices 
in knitting, if not managed properly, can expose 
employees to risks such as physical, ergonomic, 
respiratory, and fire incidents. 
Opportunity: The Lux management is firmly 
committed to the health and safety of its 
employees. The Company’s safety practises cover 
all possible measures to be taken to remove (or at 
least reduce) risks to the health, safety and welfare 
of employees, workers, contractors, authorized 
visitors, and anyone else who may be affected 
by our operations – thereby truly differentiating 
ourselves as a responsible player.
A commitment to consult and co-operate 
with workers in all matters relating to health 
and safety in the workplace is practised to 
ensure 100% safety and security of female 
employees and workers.
Wearing personal protective equipment and 
clothing and complying with management’s 
directions for health and safety is imbibed 
in our workers.
To ensure the health and safety of our 
employees and workers the Company also 
undertakes regular health camps, eye care 
camps etc.
Positive and Negative
2.
Energy 
Efficiency
Opportunity
Managing energy consumption is an important 
focus area in the garments industry. The Company 
has implemented energy-efficient practices such 
as installation of capacitors to improve the plant 
load factor, thereby lowering the Company’s energy 
consumption and operational costs.

3.
Emissions 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Greenhouse gas emissions are contributing 
to the global warming. This can create significant 
physical and transitional risks to businesses.
Opportunity: Generating power from clean and 
renewable sources can contribute to the reduction 
of greenhouse gas emissions and promote a cleaner 
environment
The Company acknowledges the significance 
of reducing greenhouse gas emission 
impact and has established an emissions 
management strategy to accomplish this 
goal. 
At the Dankuni facility, the Company 
installed a 1 MW rooftop solar panel 
that meets 35% of the plant’s electricity 
demands. The Company is also exploring 
opportunities 
to 
further 
enhance 
its 
capacity.
Positive & Negative
4. 
Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: If waste is not managed efficiently, it can have 
an impact on the environment. The manufacturing 
process can generate leftovers such as cloth scraps, 
packaging, and other materials.
Opportunity: Selecting majorly eco-friendly raw 
materials, 
automated 
cutting 
processes, 
and 
implementing waste reduction measures such 
as recycling, and reusing can help reduce the 
Company’s environmental impact. 
The nature of the Company’s business is such 
that there are negligible hazardous process 
wastes, which are disposed responsibly.
The Company reduces waste by optimizing 
the cutting process using state-of-the-art 
technology. Further, 95% of the leftover 
fabric cuttings are resold and ultimately 
used for the purpose of recycling and 
creation of products.
Positive & Negative
5.
Well-being of 
Employees
Opportunity
Commitment to employee well-being is a crucial 
aspect of the Company’s sustainability strategy. 
Valuing our human capital through a wholesome 
employee value proposition is critical for long-term 
business viability and sustainability. 
The Company prioritises promoting a holistic 
experience for our employees through regular 
training, 
skill-upgradation 
and 
employee 
engagement programs. In addition, the Company 
organizes 
financial 
management 
sessions 
on 
aspects such as group medical insurance, PF, ESIC, 
tax awareness, etc. to further enhance the financial 
knowledge of our employees.

The Company’s fabric knitting, cutting, and stitching activities do not involve dealing with any hazardous waste in

waste generated from these activities, such as cloth cuttings, is made from natural yarn and is easily recyclable. About 
95% of this waste is sold to recyclers, who use it as input in other industries. The Company strives to minimize plastic 
in its packing, wherever possible, and any residual plastic is sold to authorized vendors. Other paper-based packing 
materials are recyclable and sold to responsible vendors.

strongly believes in promoting inclusivity and economic empowerment. To achieve this, the Company actively 
seeks out partnerships with small, tiny, and cottage units for our garment-making job work. By engaging these 
suppliers, we not only contribute to their growth and sustainability but also create opportunities for individuals 
from marginalized communities to participate in the supply chain. This approach aligns with our commitment to 
social responsibility and creating a more equitable business ecosystem.
(b)	 From which marginalized /vulnerable groups do you procure? 
	
The Company prefers to engage with individuals from socioeconomically weaker sections who may face barriers to 
employment and economic opportunities. The Company’s procurement approach provides them with opportunities 
for economic well-being and social development.
